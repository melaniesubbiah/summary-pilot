### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand. He is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

The first question will ask you to evaluate a summary sentence.

##### Question: Is this sentence in the summary consistent with the story?

The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story. The lines in the summary that do so can be classified as inconsistent. Some lines include commentary about the story, which should be ignored when evaluating consistency. For such lines, select N/A. For summary A:

* The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain: **Yes**
* One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees: **Yes**
* The story paints a vivid image of human suffering: **N/A, just commentary**

For summary B:

* Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain.: **Yes**
* One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand: **Yes**
* He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall: **No**

##### Question (for any answers marked No): Provide an explanation for your selection.

For every line marked inconsistent, provide a short explanation for your answer selection. For example, for the line from **Summary B**: "He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall.", a possible response is:

This line is inconsistent with the story since the minister was sitting in the puddle of water in the story instead of lying in it.

The next panel will show you an alternate version of the summary sentence, and ask:

##### Question: Would you swap the sentence in the summary with this alternate?

You should answer **Yes** if the alternate sentence is more consistent with the story or clarifies any ambiguities you were unsure of in the sentence. If the opposite is true, then answer **No**. If they're both equally good/bad, then you can respond **Neutral**.

In some cases, based on which version of the sentence you preferred, a final panel will ask you about some possible issues with the sentence you rejected. You will be shown an issue and asked:

##### Question: Is this issue an important part of why you preferred the other sentence?

You should answer **Yes** if you agree the described issue is a problem with the sentence you rejected. If you can see why the issue might be a problem but it doesn't feel important, you can answer **Neutral**. If you don't think the described issue is a problem, you should answer **No**.
