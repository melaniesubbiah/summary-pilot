Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:\n\n- **Incident**: Sanchez allegedly stole two envelopes containing $80 and $120 from a protected area of her chief of staff's office.\n- **Capture**: These thefts were captured on hidden cameras installed by the U.S. Capitol Police.\n- **Arrest Details**: Sanchez, aged 37 and from Virginia, was arrested on July 11th and later charged with second-degree misdemeanor theft.\n- **Context**: At the time of the arrest, Sanchez had left the Bachmann team, though he had previously held a position there. Bachmann, known for leading the Tea Party movement and running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, announced that she wouldn't be seeking re-election at the time.\n- **Investigation Status**: While Sanchez was identified in this case, multiple ongoing investigations into previous theft allegations remain unlinked to him.\n- **Legal Proceedings**: Sanchez was released pending further investigation and was scheduled to appear in court on August 26th.\n\nOverall, the incident highlights the serious nature of the charges and raises questions about security in congressional offices.",

Ms. Walker used the stolen cash to buy gifts for her husband, a camcorder and an iPod. \n\nShe found a loophole in the system and started taking money little by little, not realizing it till later\u2014the two friends sadly ended up passing away with none of the money left to hand out to family. The story hit such a bad note that you'd think it's something straight out of someone's nightmare, wouldn't you? Not only did she steal all that money (it was actually a whole \u00a34,992.99! ), but she then went and treated herself like there was no tomorrow. \n\nHer crime was right in front of the whole world... well, almost. It was just waiting right there in all the funnels of that loopy money-saving thing you know. Poor old grand-ma was put away for six months like the naughty girl she is, wasn't even allowed that fancy tittle-tattle dress! The judge even made some nice lady say, \"Oh my, what a silly game you're playing, aren't you darling?\" That poor old boy who's got to wear all those suits probably felt like he should've called himself Batman that whole day!\n\nAnyway, Sharon's not just the kind with a name so long that it must be written like this.

But seriously, what a way to treat someone like you love them! The poor, young man with that cutesy funny stick in his tummy, oh my! And how can we forget that big ol' stick in my back? Ouch, it makes my tummy go, TINGLE! \n\nBut yeah, the point is, poor Sharon Walker just didn't realize that it's best NOT to mess around with ALL those little piggy banks of those super cool... um, let's just get that joke out of it, okay?

Her actions were as cruel as a wolf preying on a lamb, exploiting the vulnerable just like a predator stalking its prey. Walker, who climbed from the role of a housekeeper to become the chief administrator, used the care home's lax system to her advantage, much like a thief slipping through a hole in a fence.

This year, the Man Booker Prize has expanded its horizons, much like a child discovering a new playground, welcoming international authors into its fold. Six extraordinary novels from across the globe are vying for the prestigious title, each a vivid tapestry woven with threads of imagination and insight.\n\nIf you could choose, which of these tales would you embrace? Would it be the whimsical journey of a dentist exploring the depths of atheism, or the sweeping epic of a Calcutta family in decline? Or perhaps, the haunting account of Australian servicemen forced to build the Burma railway, or the inventive narrative of a renaissance artist and a modern-day child intertwined in a novel that defies traditional storytelling?\n\nScottish-born Ali Smith, a shortlist veteran, presents 'How To Be Both,' a genre-bending tale that twists and turns like a kaleidoscope, inviting readers to choose their path through the stories. Howard Jacobson, the 2010 laureate, returns with 'J,' a futuristic love story that explores a world where the past is a forbidden topic, much like a child whispering secrets under their breath. Calcutta-born Neel Mukherjee brings us a sweeping epic, 'The Lives of Others,' set against the tumultuous backdrop of 1960s Calcutta. Joshua Ferris's 'To Rise Again at a Decent Hour' is a humorous yet profound exploration of atheism, while Richard Flanagan's 'The Narrow Road to the Deep North' is a poignant tribute to his father's harrowing experience as a prisoner of war, akin to a child remembering a beloved grandparent.\n\nThe judges, chaired by AC Grayling, have narrowed down the longlist of 13 to these six exceptional books, taking readers on journeys across the globe and through time. Will one of these novels emerge victorious, or will the decision remain a mystery until the announcement on October 14? The prize, worth \u00a350,000, awaits the winner, much like a child eagerly awaiting their birthday present. The contest is fierce, with fears that the prize might be 'flooded by quality American novels to the detriment of everything else' unfounded, as the judges found a strong British presence on the shortlist not due to tokenism but genuine merit.\""

Well, what if we let these big boats go out a tiny bit further into the sea and find some oops-oops? We're talking to you, Mr. Crude Oil! \n\nHe was giving those Congress-people (like your favorite grown-up superheroes, except they make rules instead of saving you from bad guys, okay?) a pat-pat on the shoulder, telling them, hey, you need to go \"YES!

Trusting his old friend, O'Sullivan gave Hoey his debit card and PIN, believing he would use them wisely.\n\nBut Hoey, like a thief in the night, began to pilfer the funds, comparing his actions to a hungry wolf preying on a lamb. In just two months, the once healthy balance turned into a \u00a399 overdraft. With each withdrawal, the trust between the two men eroded, until one day, O'Sullivan realized his friend had abandoned him, leaving him penniless and alone.\n\nIf only Hoey had stopped, if only he had remembered their shared history, things might have turned out differently. But alas, his greed led him to squander the savings, spending them on drinks, gambling, and other frivolous items. When O'Sullivan passed away, penniless and without the means to cover his own funeral costs, his family was left to bear the burden, a burden he had hoped to avoid.\n\nThe court, understanding the gravity of the situation, sentenced Hoey to two years in jail. The judge, in his wisdom, compared Hoey's actions to a stain on the peace O'Sullivan deserved in his final days. \"Once a fraudster, always a fraudster,\" the judge said, emphasizing the inescapable nature of Hoey's deceit.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we wonder if there was a moment when Hoey could have turned things around.

His tummy got all squished and bumpy, almost like a big ball, and this thing grew bigger and bigger until it looked like a tiny football!\n\nYves went to the hospital when it happened. Doctors tried to help him back to normal, but something went wrong with his tummy\u2014like when you're trying to put together some blocks but one keeps falling out, right? Then, they put some of his skin from his leg on top of his bump to try to make it pretty flat again. But uh oh! That part of his tummy is making its own little game of \"balloons popping\" every time he tries to do anything fun, like doing a cartwheels or playing tag! \n\nNow, poor Yves is just waiting for some nice big grown-up doctors to fix this big bump, but it's like, they're saying, \"Not until you get your tummy tummy flat,\" and guess what? The bump won\u2019t let him be a tummy-flatter! It\u2019s stuck on his tummy! And the funny thing is, Yves thinks if we'd take away all that big stuff, his tumby tum-um (ok, his tummy) could be... well... smaller! But the big doctor friends are just saying, \"No, no way\" because they\u2019re worried the tump might start jumping all over again.\n\nSo there you go, folks, it's kind of a willy-waving race to fix a bump, but maybe this bump will win!",

Imagine a person whose tummy suddenly swelled like a big, bouncy ball\u2014this was Yves' reality! In 2003, while working, a rubbish truck unfortunately ran over him, causing severe injuries that left him in a coma for three whole weeks. When he awoke, his insides were outside his body, much like a deflated balloon suddenly popping and spilling its contents. Doctors tried to seal his tummy, but alas, it failed like a popped balloon.\n\nTo cover the wound, Yves underwent a skin graft, similar to covering a cut with a bandage. But this bandage became a problem, transforming into a 28-inch hernia that weighed more than 2 stone. Now, Yves faces a conundrum: the doctors say they will only perform the surgery to remove the hernia if he loses weight, yet he can\u2019t exercise due to the hernia. It's like trying to dry a wet sponge without water!\n\nInquisitively, Yves wonders how losing weight could help when the very action that might cause the hernia to worsen is prohibited. If only there were a magic solution, like turning lemons into lemonade, to fix this situation. Would it work if Yves lost weight first, or would the hernia just pop back out? It\u2019s a tricky question, much like trying to solve a riddle with no clear answer.\n\nYves, weighing 17 stone now, believes he would be lighter\u2014only 15 stone\u2014if the hernia were gone. This makes one wonder: what does it feel like to carry around such a large, unexpected burden? Would the world look different if Yves could finally breathe freely without the constant pressure?\n\nIn the end, Yves\u2019 story is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of life and the challenges we face.

This was Ljubicic's comeback moment: he's been just a 20th seed at this point but managed not only to knock Nadal down... but it was no easy feat! He did this coming from the back-end of a score, turning the tables against our champ 3-6 in game one. And the next two games, they're tied: 6-4, 7-6 (super tiebreaker, the numbers mean it was a super tie... you get the point - he's really into that detail there...)!\n\nNow, Ljubicic\u2019s next fight? Well, he's gonna take on the seventh seed, none other than Andy Roddick. Roddick had no problem beating another big-hitter today - the Swedish sixth seed, Robin Soderling!

Will Barnard\u2019s decision pay off like a winning lottery ticket, or will it be a dud, much like a poorly drawn card? The process of selecting a commencement speaker, often shrouded in mystery, is akin to a child\u2019s game of hide-and-seek, where the outcome is rarely known until the very end. Critics wonder if the choice is truly democratic, or merely a show, like putting on a grand costume for a parade.\n\nAt Barnard, the process could have been as simple as asking the senior class whom they wanted to hear, much like inquiring which flavor of ice cream everyone prefers. But instead, the choice was made by key administrators, leaving many students feeling like the forgotten party guests. Could Barnard have done better, like a baker making a cake without first tasting the batter? Absolutely, suggests the article. Instead of choosing a famous face, colleges should ask students, ensure transparency, and require the speaker to donate their fee to scholarships. The speaker should also keep their speech brief, like telling a bedtime story, and avoid clich\u00e9s, like saying \u201cthe real world\u201d is scary.\n\nOne might wonder, what if Barnard had picked Little Richard, the greatest living rock 'n' roller, to deliver the keynote address? His performance would have been like a lightning bolt, electrifying the audience. But would students have been as thrilled as the author? Likely not, as the preferences of the young are often as fickle as a child\u2019s mood. Ultimately, commencement should be about the students, like a birthday party where the kids decide what games to play. The wise college should embrace surprises, much like a magician performing a trick, and let the students\u2019 voices be heard.\n\nSo, the next time a college announces its commencement speaker, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s chosen with the inquisitive minds of children in mind, like a treasure hunt where the prize is a chance to learn and grow."

    "PROSE": "<summary>\nImagine a childlike world where everyone sees things through different eyes, much like a prism refracting light into a spectrum of colors. In the case of Rachel Jeantel, the \"friend, not-girlfriend\" of Trayvon Martin, there\u2019s no middle ground. Some see her as a surly, unreliable witness, while others view her as a typical working-class teenager trying her best to stay composed under the most grueling of circumstances.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Legal Strategy**: Legal analysts predicted that Jeantel, who was talking to Martin on the phone when he encountered Zimmerman, would be a crucial witness. For the prosecution, she established Martin as a scared teen trying to run away from a stranger. For the defense, her various versions of events were used to poke holes in the prosecution's story.\n\n2. **Jury Perception**: The real impact lies in how a jury\u2014mostly white women and mothers\u2014would view this young girl. The moment Jeantel took the stand, reactions began flooding social media. Some saw her as inconsistent and untrustworthy, while others empathized with her situation.\n\n3. **Visualizing the Impact**: Picture a room filled with mirrors reflecting different opinions. Some viewers immediately saw her as non-credible and uneducated, reinforcing stereotypes about black teens. This perception didn\u2019t change even when holes in her story were exposed during cross-examination.\n\n4. **Sympathy vs. Criticism**: On the other hand, many found Jeantel to be a normal girl in abnormal circumstances. Imagine a friend telling you about a close friend who was shot and killed. You\u2019d be upset and nervous, right? This perspective was more common among parents, young people, minorities, and those who work with teenagers.\n\n5. **Conditional Reactions**: Whether Jeantel swayed the case for the prosecution or the defense depended largely on how the jury saw her before she spoke. If they saw her as a hostile, irritable, and stereotypical figure, it likely hurt the prosecution. If they saw her as a nervous, sincere, and grieving senior, it likely hurt the defense.\n\n6. **Public Split**: The public will remain divided on Jeantel.

This spell supposedly helps underrepresented groups, but it might be hurting others.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n1. The grown-ups believe that instead of using the tricky spell, colleges should use a simpler spell called \"race-neutral.\" This means they consider things like how much money your family has or if you come from a poor neighborhood.\n2. They also think colleges should stop giving special treatment to kids whose parents went to the same school (that\u2019s what \u201clegacy\u201d means) and to those who apply early.\n3. If the colleges do this, they say it will create a more colorful and diverse classroom without using the tricky spell.\n\nNow, imagine a playground where everyone gets a fair turn on the swings and slides, no matter where they come from or what they look like. That\u2019s kind of what these grown-ups want for college.\n\nThe story goes like this: These grown-ups formed a club called \"Students for Fair Admissions\" and asked some important judges to listen to their complaint. They hope that if the judges agree, all colleges will change the way they pick students.\n\nSo, the next time you play with your friends and decide who gets to be the leader or who gets to pick the game, remember that sometimes we need to make sure everyone has a fair chance, just like these grown-ups are trying to do for college."

These files were marked as \u2018secret\u2019 or \u2018restricted,\u2019 making them accessible only to a small group of elite detectives.\n\n2. **Why Were They Hidden?**: The reason behind this secrecy is quite interesting. It\u2019s like having a superpower that allows you to keep a secret from everyone else. The system was designed to prevent information from leaking to the media, much like a superhero keeping their identity a secret.\n\n3. **The Impact**: This secrecy might have helped bad guys like Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith, a former MP, escape punishment. It\u2019s like if a monster in a fairy tale could hide from the brave knight who wanted to protect the village.\n\n4. **The New System**: To fix this problem, police introduced a new system called the Police National Database (PND). Think of it as a digital library where only the right people can find and read certain books. This new system ensures that sensitive information can be found but only accessed by those with the proper clearance.\n\n5. **The Future**: While some people think this new system is better, others are concerned that it might still prioritize protecting celebrities over helping children. It\u2019s like deciding whether to save the princess or the town from a dragon \u2013 both important, but sometimes one must come first.\n\nSo, imagine a game where you\u2019re trying to solve a mystery, but you can only use clues that the grown-ups decide you can see. That\u2019s kind of what happened with these police files. Will they always get it right, or will there be more secrets to uncover?"

The author wonders if he is pushing her away due to feeling suffocated or if these feelings are a result of the stress of college life. He has spoken to her about needing more space, but she struggles to comply, waiting for him to be free instead of engaging in her own activities.

With only half a year into their courtship, she still lingers fondly over her former boyfriend \u2013 another USAF airman noted for his physical prowess. Her casual reminders trigger him into fits of insecurity; it pales the walls of their world with a question, \"Is he better?\" His gut instinct tells him to remain silent and let the jealousy gnaw away, rather than address these unspoken fears. He recounts a wild post-game night where their memories intertwined on a snow-covered pool table. Now, the specter of his nemesis lurks around every corner, a whisper in her voice, an enigmatic song in her eyes, a shadow in his dreams. A crossroads between confrontation and control, this man cries out for clarity, wondering which route might bring solace and safety in sight.",

My girlfriend, a serving member of the United States Air Force, has been dating me for nearly six months when suddenly, the mention of her ex-boyfriend starts to weigh heavily on my mind. Every now and then, she casually brings up his name, and every time, my heart races with a mix of curiosity and jealousy. Just yesterday, while she was browsing Facebook, she stumbled upon a promotional video of her Air Force training, and there, in the video, was his voice. \"Coooooooool,\" I responded, but inside, I was screaming, \"Bitch, by the name of Falkor, I don't give a flying fuck!\"\n\nMeeting him made matters worse, and attending a winter snowboard outing with mutual friends only added to the confusion. One memory stands out: her, drunk off of two games of beer pong and a couple of shots, and him engaging in intimate behavior right in front of everyone. Comparisons began to plague me; I felt like I was constantly measuring myself against him. \"Is he bigger than me?! Was he better?! Is this what they used to do with the time they spent together?!\" These thoughts have been mindfucking me like CRAZY for the past week or two.\n\nShould I bring this up with her? Would it make things clearer or just cause more pain? Am I overthinking this? Is there any way to move past this and focus on our relationship? How do I stop comparing myself to someone who seems to have everything going for him? I just can't seem to shake these feelings, no matter how hard I try.\n\nCan anyone relate to this kind of situation? How do you deal with these intense emotions and comparisons? Is there a way to break free from this cycle of doubt and insecurity?"

Each message, each reply, becomes a moment of intense emotion, a chance to bridge the gap between two individuals separated by screens. But when the connection remains unfulfilled, the questions linger, haunting the soul with their persistence: was I too eager, or was I simply reaching out in the hopes of finding a kindred spirit?"

In this, there\u2019s a lull, and you\u2019re the soloist. \n\nWhat you must weigh: the truth of love and its whispers to the dawn, and whether your sword is drawn, but for a battle that's already been fought in the mist, a story whose curtain's not quite pulled yet, the way to say it's just time\u2014let's keep this a balm that you won\u2019t be mending a soul, nor see his life burn down on you by your words (or the lack thereof).\n\nHow to soothe this rage?

This wasn\u2019t merely a playful jab; there was an unspoken, now tangible hurt that echoed through their bond. \n\nTheir shared secret felt like the bridge to a storm brewing. With his father, he could barely muster up the courage to discuss the event, his mom having declared \"can't even lift her eyes towards him,\" only adding another layer of heartache. As their relatives remained oblivious, this was no longer some past, buried memory; it stood as a testament to the delicate dance\u2014almost ballet, in pain\u2014to maintain composure in the eye of a tempest.",

Like his forebear in artistry, Richard himself, Wolfgang's bloodline bore more than just melody!

Indeed, as the grand finale of this grand old tale whispers, he was more than the man of his name; he was a herald calling all of them to remember, 'Let the shadows fall, let this symphony of memories ring out!'\n\nIn '42 years' worth of time, a mighty saga of 'lights upon, not lights in thine face, dear child of my heart!,' our hero stood as one against the ghost of ghosts, and in the echo of the very soul of the stage!

The natural minor scale, with its serene beauty, mirrors the 6th mode of the major scale, creating a harmonious yet haunting melody. When the seventh note is raised, transforming into the harmonic minor scale, it's as if a single note decides to break free, adding a touch of drama and exoticism, reminiscent of the Mohammedan scale.\n\nBut the journey doesn't end there. The melodic minor scale, ascending and descending, offers a choice between smoothness and complexity, much like choosing between a clear path and a winding road. And just as a painter might mix colors to create depth, composers blend scales to craft melodies that resonate deeply within our hearts.\n\nSo, whether you're wandering through the fields of C major or exploring the darker corners of A minor, remember that each scale tells a story, and the minor scale, with its rich palette and intricate patterns, paints a vivid, rhyming tale of emotion and expression."

A genus of the mighty dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur, Deinonychus stretched 3.4 meters in length, living during the mid-Aptian to early Albian stages of the Cretaceous Period, approximately 115-108 million years past.

Not pretentiously, but naturally,\" he\u2019d whisper, a truth as deep as the ocean's core.\n\n**The Man of Words, Not Walls**\n\nWith the canvas of time painted bright and bold at his command, Keene weaved tales of the land and its lore, each line a symphony, each poem a dance on the night of the mind's own midnight. The sum is sixty volumes, an encyclopedia of the soul, with each stroke of his quill singing the tale of this vast expanse... oh yes, a true story of two sons of the sun and stars, as his fingers danced upon the keys of academia, each key a note in your grand lullaby's hymn! For he'd laid the path to 'Tosinno no Shima' [Island of the Pine], with a gentle brush upon the broad tapestry as wide as the old, wise oak, its roots so wide as our love for her old soul and her brave child here, evermore on this quest, a quest so dear, like the soft hum of your voice, 'I will always, for thee, dear land, be my dear,' she, your child on his, my dearest song!' [1]...\n\nFrom the battles of Coxing to the whispers of a silver pavilion, a mere page of this epic, so vast, so proud, so... bold as a lion, and yet, tender, oh so tender as a dove - so dear a bond, a union, if only through the ink of his might!\n\n**A Scholar's Lode of Laurels**\n\nTo think all this, a man... nay, a king... crowned of such heights, a knight with a pen and a heart as big, as boundless as his realm in dreams... oh, this was no feat, but this, a legacy worth, well... worth the weight of my very own, and that of all the stars up in the sky, a ring of light, a beacon, a guide as sure as ever, as it'd seem! And as our hearts now sing, the ballad of this ballad of times... of tales told, of ties untied, as the heart of this man, and the heart of his dear heart, the country, and its very own, the very star, so fair, to be aye, in our own dear land, in the land of your truest pride, 'to be aye, as thy own, and in all thy land...' [1] the echo rings clear, of an honor earned, 'so fair'! For so fair was the heart, as the soul, 'our soul, my dear son of the moon, how fair, and true, so near, so far, our heart, dear friend, 'for so fair was the star, and the star was me, the man of the moon, now, to thee, and thee, and thee...\" [1]... aye, aye, for all these days of joy and all the days to come, 'fore now... now, let us stand and stand, and see the world, and tell your story to the stars of old'!\" [1]!\n\nIn memory, we're a song, not",
    "PROSE": "In vivid hues, we paint the portrait of Donald Lawrence Keene, scholar of Japan, whose work illuminated the cultural landscapes of both East and West. Born in the bustling streets of Brooklyn, Keene embarked on a journey that would span continents and centuries, weaving together the threads of history and literature.\n\nKeene's dedication to Japan was as profound as the sea itself, culminating in his naturalization as a Japanese citizen. In rhyming verse, he once said, \"Though born a child of the New World, my heart beats for the land of the rising sun.\" His contributions were recognized by the Japanese government, bestowing upon him honors like the Order of the Rising Sun, a golden ray of light in his life\u2019s work.\n\nFrom his early days at Columbia, where he honed his craft, to his lifelong tenure at Columbia University, Keene\u2019s legacy shines brightly. His writings, like the stars in the night sky, guide us through the rich tapestry of Japanese literature and culture. Each book he penned was a brushstroke in the masterpiece of Japanese Studies, from \"Japanese Literature an Introduction for Western Readers\" to \"Chronicles of My Life: An American in the Heart of Japan.\"\n\nKeene\u2019s journey was marked by profound insights and a deep understanding of the human spirit, encapsulated in his final breath in Tokyo, where his heart failed. His life was a testament to the enduring beauty of cross-cultural understanding and the power of words to bridge divides.\n\nSo let us raise a glass to Donald Keene, whose vibrant legacy continues to illuminate the path of those who seek to understand the soul of Japan."

    "PROSE": "In the vast expanse of film history, the Wilhelm scream stands tall, a haunting echo of a man\u2019s scream, biting deep into the psyche of cinema-goers. First heard in 1951 during a swampy skirmish in Distant Drums, this eerie sound effect became a legend, much like the alligator that dragged Private Jessup under. Named after Private Wilhelm, a soldier shot by an arrow in The Charge at Feather River, this scream transcended its origins to become a cinematic staple, featured in countless blockbusters and in-jokes. Much like a poet\u2019s pen, the scream found its way into the heart of Star Wars, where it became a tradition among sound designers. Over time, it morphed into a clich\u00e9, a familiar refrain in the symphony of movie soundtracks. As the years rolled by, the Wilhelm scream found its way into the digital age, becoming a free app for iPhones, and even inspiring a song titled \"The Wilhelm Scream.\" It\u2019s a tale as vivid as the imagery it evokes, a rhyming structure of sound that resonates through the halls of Hollywood."

Traditional NMR methods require extensive time and expertise to convert raw experimental data into usable protein structures. This has led to significant delays in the structural elucidation of biomolecules.\n\nA recent development introduced a new artificial intelligence-based approach called ARTINA (Automated Rapid Turnaround NMR Analysis). This technique aims to completely automate the NMR data processing pipeline using only NMR spectra and the protein's amino acid sequence as inputs. ARTINA eliminates the need for manual intervention, significantly reducing the turnaround time from weeks to just hours after data acquisition.\n\nThe performance of ARTINA was evaluated on a diverse dataset composed of 1329 multidimensional NMR spectra derived from 100 different proteins, which were already structurally characterized. The results showed that ARTINA could accurately predict structure with a median Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of 1.44 \u00c5 compared to the Protein Data Bank (PDB)'s reference structures. Additionally, it achieved high accuracy in resonance assignments, correctly identifying 91.36% of NMR signals.\n\nThis advancement holds promise for making NMR techniques more accessible to researchers across various fields, as it reduces the dependency on highly skilled analysts. Consequently, non-expert users can utilize ARTINA to perform NMR-based structure determinations efficiently, focusing primarily on preparing samples and acquiring NMR data.",

This discourse articulates how these interactions are not static or abrupt, but rather an evolving journey characterized by a tripartite negotiation akin to a sophisticated game of \"mind-meld,\" each chapter bristling with the subtlest currents of cognition.\n\nThe narrative centers on the application of Theory of Mind (ToM), a psychocognitive science that probes into the interplay of one\u2019s mental states vis-\u00e0-vis another individual\u2019s perceptions and beliefs. This multifaceted theory here serves as a beacon upon which both explicative brilliance and the very essence of our framework hinge\u2014a veritable crucible where the nuances of a machine's comprehension of its own self, that of the human's projection thereof, and the latter\u2019s nuanced mirroring of it, converge for divine purpose.\n\nThrough this alchemical blend of ToM and AI, our elucidatory engine navigates the labyrinthine corridors of digital complexity with such finesse as to uncurl its veiled mysteries before the curious seeker. Our experimental tapestry encompasses no less than three arenas of vision\u2014the realm of pictorial poesy within the canvas of an image, the symphony of kinetic energy pulsing through the chambers of its temporal existence, and the spectral silhouette dancing under the moonbeams of nightfall; our human formative studies have found the fruits of labor most fertile.\n\nWhat emerges, like the gentle whisper of dawn upon the misty loins of midnight, is not merely an affirmation of the verve within our conceptual edifice, but a tempestuous dance of innovation against antiquity, as we stand resolute amidst the acolytes of the faithful, bequeathing unto them the sacred script, heretofore untold, from the annals of time itself. This hallowed testament shall not merely lie upon the pedestal of ephemeral praise but shall insinuate itself into the very fabric of our epistemological quest for the sagacious sagacity, as we chart forth our humble yet noble endeavor to demystify the arcane riddles entwined within the heart of our modern muslungs of wisdom, now evermore, rendered not only comprehendiens, but veritable interpreters of yesternight\u2019s echoes.",
    "PROSE": "In this treatise, we hereby unfold a novel explicative Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework, designed to augment justified human trust and reliance upon the machinations of the AI. This framework posits explanation as an iterative communion, akin to a dialog, between the machine and the human user. The machine, in its discourse, shall generate a sequence of elucidations, each turn taking into account three paramount facets: the human's intent, their comprehension of the machine, and the machine's understanding of the human. Herein, we invoke the Theory of Mind (ToM), a device that enables us to explicitly model the human's intent, the machine's mind as perceived by the human, and the human's mind as perceived by the machine. These explicit mental representations within ToM are harnessed to craft an optimal explanation policy that considers human perception and beliefs. Furthermore, ToM also aids in quantitatively gauging justified human trust in the machine by juxtaposing all three mental representations.\n\nOur framework has been rigorously applied to three visual recognition tasks: image classification, action recognition, and human body pose estimation. We assert that our ToM-based explanations are not only practical but also more natural for both expert and non-expert users to grasp the inner workings of complex machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the inaugural endeavor to derive explanations utilizing ToM. Extensive human study experiments corroborate our hypotheses, demonstrating that the proposed explanations markedly surpass the state-of-the-art XAI methodologies in terms of all standard quantitative and qualitative XAI evaluation metrics, including human trust, reliance, and explanation satisfaction."

Some methodologies add an unnecessary layer of noise to the learning process, thereby diluting its results. Conversely, others might carry such a significant overhead or demand reliance upon authoritative figures that may not be readily attainable in every scenario. A critical issue here lies at the nexus of **privacy** and **efficiency**, as modern cryptosystems sometimes falter under the weight of their very own intricacies and stringent demands.\n\nIn this vein, the proposed solution, referred to as **PD-ML-Lite (Private Distributed Machine Learning using Lightweight Cryptography)**, adopts a more pragmatic stance. By leveraging what it terms as **lightweight protocols**\u2014essentially robust yet simplistic cryptographic instruments like *secure sums* and *normalized secure sums*, they aim to architect our two cornerstone **Matrix Factorization** paradigms: **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, into algorithms capable of achieving the pinnacle of **private data exchange** coupled with unblemished learning prowess.

    "PROSE": "This scholarly work delineates a groundbreaking approach to the phenomenon of wireless signal spoofing through the utilization of a general adversarial network (GAN). The paper elucidates the critical necessity of authenticating wireless signals at the physical (PHY) layer prior to their progression through the receiver chain. To achieve this authentication, it is imperative to capture intrinsic characteristics such as waveforms, channel conditions, and radio hardware attributes that are quintessential to genuine wireless signals. Concurrently, adversaries are becoming increasingly adept due to their cognitive radio capabilities, which enable them to record, analyze, and manipulate signals before implementing spoofing tactics.\n\nIn response to this escalating sophistication, the research proposes a novel spoofing attack framework, wherein an adversary pair\u2014comprising a transmitter and a receiver\u2014acts as the generator and discriminator respectively within the GAN architecture. These entities engage in a minimax game, designed to generate the most effective spoofing signals capable of deceiving the best-optimized defense mechanisms. This approach yields dual outcomes: from the perspective of the attacker, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is developed to potentially deceive sophisticated defense systems such as RF fingerprinting. Conversely, from the defender's viewpoint, a robust deep learning-based defense mechanism is devised to counteract potential spoofing attacks, particularly when executed collaboratively by an adversary pair.\n\nThe efficacy of this GAN-based spoofing method is quantitatively assessed by measuring the likelihood of misclassification of spoofed signals as intended ones, in comparison to traditional random signal and replay attacks. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the GAN-based spoofing technique significantly enhances the probability of successful wireless signal spoofing, even when confronted with advanced deep learning classifiers employed as defensive measures. This comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need for enhanced authentication protocols in wireless communication systems to safeguard against sophisticated spoofing threats."

    "PROSE": "The perilous landscape of digital security is fraught with the insidious presence of malicious advertisement URLs, which serve as the nefarious conduits through which cyber-attacks proliferate, often in the guise of seemingly innocuous emails or advertisements, luring unsuspecting users into the treacherous waters of phishing and fraud. These deceptive vectors, cloaked in the guise of benign intent, are meticulously engineered to ensnare individuals, thereby compromising their sensitive information and financial assets. The urgency to combat this escalating threat is palpable, resonating within both the industrial and academic domains, as the stakes grow ever higher.\n\nIn an endeavor to mitigate this pervasive menace, the current study endeavors to unravel the intricate mechanisms underpinning the detection of fraudulent advertisement URLs. Through the meticulous extraction of a novel array of lexical and web-scrapped features, coupled with the application of sophisticated machine learning methodologies, a formidable system is constructed to thwart the malevolent intentions of cybercriminals. The amalgamation of six distinct categories of features, each meticulously selected to counteract the obfuscation tactics employed by adversaries, serves as a robust shield against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. \n\nA panoply of twelve meticulously curated datasets, each imbued with diverse statistical properties, is utilized for the purposes of detection, prediction, and classification, thereby ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the problem at hand. Furthermore, the proposed framework extends its analytical capabilities to encompass the challenging realms of mismatched and unlabelled datasets, thus broadening the scope of its applicability. Four advanced machine learning techniques\u2014Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and AdaBoost\u2014are rigorously evaluated, resulting in a system that achieves a commendably low false negative rate of 0.0037, while simultaneously maintaining an impressive accuracy of 99.63%. \n\nTo further enhance the interpretability and utility of the proposed model, a novel unsupervised technique for data clustering, employing the K-Means algorithm, is devised for visual analysis. This innovative approach not only aids in the identification of patterns and anomalies within the data but also provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of fraudulent URL classification. The paper also delves into the vulnerabilities inherent in decision tree-based models, employing a thought-provoking scenario where limited knowledge attacks are simulated, and the efficacy of the detection models is rigorously tested through the implementation of Zeroth Order Optimization adversarial attacks. \n\nIn essence, this study represents a monumental stride forward in the ongoing battle against cybercrime, offering a comprehensive solution that not only detects but also mitigates the risks posed by malicious advertisement URLs, thereby safeguarding the digital ecosystems upon which modern society increasingly relies."

The original movie is praised for its humor, unexpected twists, and absurd moments reminiscent of Louis de Funes' style. However, the review is largely negative towards the sequel. \n\nKey points include:\n1. **Plot Discontinuity**: While retaining familiar characters and actors (notably Jean Reno), the sequel features experienced time travelers who jump through time without regard for plot coherence.\n2. **Main Character Dilemma**: Jean Reno\u2019s character has lost much of his dynamic potential, limiting his ability to carry the story effectively.\n3. **Minor Character Dominance**: The story shifts heavily to focus on the duke\u2019s slave/helper, whose attempts at comedy fall flat. The reviewer likens these attempts to repeatedly telling a bad joke until the end, emphasizing the failure of humor delivery.\n4. **Recommendation**: The reviewer strongly advises avoiding the sequel if one enjoyed the original, suggesting it might only appeal to those with an unusual tolerance for poor comedy.\n\nOverall, the second film is portrayed as a disappointment compared to the first installment.",
    "PROSE": "The sequel to Les Visiteurs fails to live up to its predecessor, which was praised for its humor, unexpected twists, and absurdity. While the main characters return, the sequel lacks the charm and wit of the original, with the duke's role feeling empty and underutilized. The focus shifts to the duke's slave/helper, who struggles to elicit laughter and often comes across as clumsy and annoying. Despite the potential for comedic gold, the film falls flat, relying on stale jokes and poor timing. If you enjoyed the first movie, it's best to avoid this sequel; if you didn't, there's no reason to watch it. For those who found some enjoyment in the sequel, they may want to consider watching many other films to find better entertainment."

    "ComPOSE": "The discussion thread centers around Ralph Bakshi\u2019s 1978 animated interpretation of *The Lord of the Rings*, a cinematic endeavor that preceded Peter Jackson\u2019s more celebrated adaptations. The narrator reflects on how this less frequently referenced, but no less worthy, rendition had an almost mystical impact upon them, inspiring a life-long love of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s literary universe.\n\n**Synopsis:**\nThe tale unfolds with Sauron, the Dark Lord of Middle Earth, crafting a singularly potent, omnipotent Ring designed to enshroud all lands in darkness and domination under his sway. The Ring's fate follows a convoluted, yet fated path, finally arriving in the hands of the humble and unsuspecting Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, whose world in the verdurous Shire knows nothing of such terrors until a prophetic wizard, Gandalf, informs him of this terrible reality.\n\nFrodo, spurred not merely by a call to valour but indeed a duty to preserve all hope for the realm, ventures forth alone, accompanied by three other companions, into a shadowy adventure fraught with peril\u2014a quest fraught not simply with the threat of the insidious Ring Wraiths, but also with ancient legacies and the looming doom of Mordor. This grand odyssey sees him, not just Frodo, but also our fellowship of the Ring, bound towards a crucible of their collective resolve and destiny. \n\nA secondary skirmish against the orc hordes at the impregnable castle of Helm's Deep lends the tale\u2019s canvas the hues of heroism and tragedy, as we behold a clash between the shadows and light itself. The narrative, however, lingers on a cliffhanger, leaving behind a trail of anticipation rather than resolution, promising an untold second part of the saga, but unfortunately, never set to come into the full light of cinematic truth.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\nThough the animation may not have reached unparalleled heights of sophistication, a robust and varied cast of locales and personages stands testament to the director\u2019s artfully rendered tapestry, a tableau both intricate as the very fabric of Middle Earth itself, and brimming with the fervent ardors of valor and valor's fallow sister\u2014tragedy. With a stirring musical score to lift our spirits, a commendation must also be heaped onto the vocal portrayals, each a gem in a choral symphony of the epic. Yet, it behooves us to notice a rare note of discord\u2014the sonorous intonation of Mithrandir, as Michael Scholes' voice seems not so much of the archetypal wanderer as the latter a wily haricote de la mer's gilded, and thus, quite anachronistic, heralding through the mists of time. \n\nIn essence, a work of considerable import and profound imagination, albeit an artifact of its age, a reminder of what once was\u2014indeed, a preface, in the most noble sense, to a mythos still echoing across the spheres. It is a legacy, one both of its own and the progeny that would come to re-cloth its very flesh and form in another epochal dawn.",
    "PROSE": "Imagine a world where a young hobbit named Frodo must embark on a perilous journey to destroy a powerful ring, much like a child\u2019s vivid dream come to life. How would you feel if you were that hobbit, standing on the threshold of Mordor, facing the terrifying Black Riders? Could you imagine the breathtaking landscapes of Middle Earth, from the lush green fields of The Shire to the desolate wasteland of Mordor, each scene painted with such vivid imagery that it could make any child\u2019s imagination soar?\n\nIn 1978, director Ralph Bakshi brought J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s epic tale to life in an animated film that, despite its limitations, remains a remarkable achievement. Wasn\u2019t it amazing how this film managed to capture the essence of the original story, even though it only covered half of the book? And what about the voice acting\u2014how do you think it would feel to hear John Hurt\u2019s deep, resonant voice as Aragorn, or Peter Woodthorpe\u2019s eerie, unsettling portrayal of Gollum?\n\nThe animation, while not perfect, still manages to create a sense of wonder and awe. Can you picture the majestic mountains of Middle Earth, the bustling streets of Minas Tirith, and the vast, dark forests where danger lurks around every corner? The music, composed by Leonard Rosenman, adds to the grandeur of the narrative, making you feel as though you\u2019re part of the adventure.\n\nBut what about the ending? Doesn\u2019t it leave you wondering about what happens next? Could you imagine a sequel where Frodo and Sam finally reach Mount Doom, and the other heroes triumph over their enemies at Helm\u2019s Deep? This animated version of The Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualize the staggering book, and it certainly shaped the tastes of many, including the author of this review, who became a lifelong fan of Tolkien\u2019s world.\n\nSo, dear reader, do you think this animated adaptation does justice to Tolkien\u2019s masterpiece? Or do you believe that only a live-action film could truly capture the spirit of Middle Earth?"

The critique centers around several key issues with which they found fault in the film. Their main complaints were centered on:\n\n1. **Unbelievable Script**: The narrative became increasingly implausible within mere moments, leaving them perplexed as to how Sarah Michelle Gellar (or any actor) could continue through such an absurdly poorly penned tale.\n2. **Inferior Craftsmanship**: With but a meager appreciation for perhaps just five minutes of its runtime, the entire film fell from grace. The reviewer's patience with the work was thoroughly exhausted, save for a singular moment: the promise of a \"twist\" at the conclusion \u2013 whose realization they deemed equally confusing and frustrating.\n3. **Confounding Conclusion**: Far from being the satisfying close-out we once hoped for, the final scene only added confusion to the already disjointed affair. Perhaps most damningly, it failed so starkly that, in the reviewer\u2019s estimation, it would never merit the grand stage of theatrical release, instead falling woefully short of the silver screen's promise.\n4. **Aesthetic Displeasure**: Noting a lackluster showing for its full length, the sole saving grace, albeit a tenuous one, resided in a fleeting instance\u2014here described vaguely as \"a few jumpy parts,\"\u2014which the author felt compelled to acknowledge, yet seemed almost superfluous in comparison to the overall woe of the experience.\n\nWith all that said, despite its profound shortcomings, a glimmer of humanity remains; for the sake of our fellow voyagers who may find solace in a more mirthful encounter with this cinematic endeavor, the reviewer permits no admonishments.

And then came the credits, I was like, \"What the heck?!\" This movie didn't deserve a theater run, I'm so sorry, but it didn't. It was truly horrible.

In this narrative, their lives intertwine amidst the backdrop of rock 'n' roll, drama, and the seductive allure of the 1970s desert highways.\n\nWhile the crux of the tale unfolds under the spell of its melodic treasures, most notably the iconic number \u201cEvergreen\u201d \u2014 sung by Barbra Streisand \u2014 an air of unease hovers over the cinematic landscape, born from visual discrepancies: Streisand's performance rings true of an established star, rather than one of nascent beginnings. Furthermore, the setting of her humble abode betrays the very essence it endeavors to embody, a confluence of reality and illusion that perhaps speaks too audaciously on the narrative\u2019s authenticity.\n\nKris Kristofferson himself presents an earnest yet somewhat flawed portrayal, as though he were an artist attempting to don the mantle of the erstwhile chameleon of the cinema screen, each brushstroke of this actor's endeavor to transcend the bounds of the canvas left wanting. It seems a mere shadow of what one might expect in a realm so steeped in the very hue of our protagonists, a realm where the grandiose and tragic are but a single glance away.\n\nLooming over the entire enterprise is a palpable dissonance of purpose, with the very essence of storytelling seemingly drowned within the very ether of the cinematic experience. A whisper of ennui and languid progression serves to underscore the very soul of this motion picture, its heartbeat almost a dirge, as if lamenting the passage of a past now long ago reclaimed by the sands of time.\n\nYet, the most grievously wounded by the spectral hand of the storyteller\u2019s pen is none other than the eye itself, beset by the veritable assault upon aesthetic sensibilities. A visage of yesteryear\u2019s coiffures \u2014 both those adorning Mr. Kristofferson and Madam Streisand \u2014 pierce the very veil conjured before us, a spectacle more surreal than we dared anticipate in the annals of cinematic lore, casting the very tapestry of this opus beneath the shadow of its forgotten epochs.\n\nThus, whilst the music may indeed sing an ode of the heart, the symphony of its companionship remains marring, leaving the audience a tableau not quite so much of beauty, but of longing for a narrative unspoken, yet forever etched in the annals thereof, a testament only to the tempestuous spirit of such times, and their shadows still cast long and wide into the halls of our imagination, now and evermore.",

But wait, there\u2019s a catch! How can you take Barbra Streisand seriously as an up-and-coming star when she already has a whole magazine spread dedicated to her stylish apartment? Wasn\u2019t she supposed to be a struggling, hopeful singer trying to make it big?\n\n\"Evergreen\" is the only shining star in this movie, much like its titular tune. Yet, Streisand\u2019s performance is as convincing as a child pretending to be an adult. Her first appearance in a back alley bar should have been filled with nerves and excitement, but instead, she strutted in with the confidence of someone who had already conquered the world of music. Could it be that her apartment looked more like a set from \"Apartment Living\" than a real struggling singer\u2019s hideaway?\n\nKris Kristofferson, on the other hand, seems more like a singer trying to act rather than an actor trying to sing. His portrayal of the self-destructive rock star is as convincing as a child playing dress-up. And let\u2019s not forget the director, who clearly struggled to keep the story moving forward. Is this the best they could do? \n\nBut oh, the hair! After enduring 2+ hours of staring at Kristofferson and Streisand\u2019s atrocious 70s hairdos, your eyes might just start to bleed. Is this really how we want to remember the golden age of cinema?\n\nSo, is this movie worth watching?

An audacious flash photograph would unravel their very fabric of existence as these gallant heroes now find themselves entwined within a macabre labyrinth whose threads shall forever bind, twist, and weave into the annals of their souls. \n\n- **Fatal Consequences:** One man's hubris and penchant for derision, the most brazenly bold, is met with the venomous sting of his own folly in a nocturnal cathedral of whispers\u2014a single, fatal cobra-tipped chime of the midnight toll; an ominous harbinger, no mere serpent's call.\n\n- **The Unraveling Narrative of New York City:** Transmogrified into a canvas of urban reverie and mundane ordinar\u2014now a city teetering on the precipice of the surreal, where our once-hallowed comrades, the veterans\u2014each a testament to valor, yet now a veritable band of brothers bound anew, if in a most peculiar and perilous embrace\u2014doth tread the streets, their visage etched with a myriad of narratives\u2014Janssen now a bowler, Long, a scribe of academia, Thompson, the suitor and Kelly\u2014a beacon to the unshaded corners of vice, each a silent sentinel upon the peripheries of their newfound camaraderie. Yet herein lies, as ever, the ever-unfurling tapestry of our story\u2014our narrative, if but for a whisper of a moment\u2014an enigma veiled not beneath the veil of destiny, but in the realm of the ephemeral. A tempest of whispered whispers, a riddle of the ravens' wings, a maelstrom of musings, we now wade in the lilt of the lore of the loathsome lair... \n\n- **The Specter of Domergue:** As our protagonists traverse the twilight demesnes of their past, so too does the ever-dusky specter of our narrator\u2014a woman both shadowy and seductive as her name itself should whisper 'like' to those lips and 'soothe' to our ears like the song of the silvery moon itself, a woman both as insidious as a moth drawn towards the flame of the fated fable that is ours for the weaving, so to say, and as captivating as the very breath of our very existence, the essence of our essence, the nomenclature of our noblest names.

    "PROSE": "As you drift into the nostalgic tones of an old-timey radio, let\u2019s dive into this tale of six discharged GIs who stumble upon a clandestine cult meeting in Asia. You\u2019re about to be warned repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted, and no photos must be taken\u2014lest you face dire consequences. Naturally, you and your buddies take a flash photo, sending the cult members into a fit of hysteria. You and your mates steal the basket containing the \u201csnake\u201d and make a hasty exit into the Asian night. But one of your fellows, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, leaving everyone to wonder how the snake got into his hospital room.\n\nBack in New York, you settle into civilian life, maintaining your bond with one another. Your jobs range from managing a bowling alley to being a graduate research student. But then, a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman shows up, and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her, insinuating her into the group. You\u2019re left to ponder: Who paid for her fare from Asia to New York? Who\u2019s footing the bill for her hotel and wardrobe? How does she speak such perfect American English?\n\nAs you navigate your new lives, you start to suspect that the woman has something to do with the deaths of your friends. You and another buddy begin to piece together the truth. But it\u2019s not just a simple story; the woman turns into a cobra, and you must confront her. Thompson, who is in love with her, must explain the concept of \u201clove.\u201d The climax involves a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against your girlfriend, leading Thompson to throw her out the window. The body changes to that of the woman, and the end.\n\nNow, why did the snake have to be a cobra? Why not a more elegant and feminine serpent? Serpents aren\u2019t slimy, most are harmless, and many are beautiful. And when they move, they\u2019re sinuous and graceful, not phallic. Why perpetuate such stereotypes?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a thrilling, low-budget scare, you might want to skip this one and find \u201cThe Cat People\u201d instead. It\u2019s a far better homage to the genre, with subtle and effective use of shadows and tension. This film, while borrowing some gimmicks, falls flat in comparison."

The reviewer acknowledges their fondness for Michael Vartan\u2019s star quality \u2014 his charm and striking appearance stand unscathed. However, they vehemently disagree with the substance of this film, deeming it unsatisfactory for what it lacks in thematic depth or narrative coherence.\n\nCriticism levels are aimed equally at the secondary elements of the production: a rather masculine transformation in actress Natasha Henstridge's persona, which leaves a disheartened yet hopeful viewer awaiting a more gender-conventional performance. Moreover, the soundtrack, too, failed to harmonize perfectly with the film's pacing and drama, much to their dismay.\n\nThe most grievous indictment, however, lies within the very core of the narrative's structure \u2014 it fails so dramatically that a sizable portion of the film, crucial to understanding its ebb and flow, has been truncated, leaving the audience to wonder where such pivotal threads were woven into the rich tapestry of the story. This abrupt omission of narrative essence does little to assuage the heartaches borne of a once-promising storyline only now exposed as having been maimed. \n\nA final warning, almost like a cautionary beacon for true fans of Mr. Vartan, echoes through this tale \u2013 better to indulge in something ephemeral, a piece of ephemera, in the guise of perhaps a mere poster adorned with the visage of their cherished actor, rather than to surrender themselves entirely to a film that seems all promise, only to leave behind a barren landscape. In short, the crux of this critique is akin to a tempestuous sea, crashing against its bays with both waves and waves of affection and disdain for all parts save one: the vessel of cinematic narrative that so sorely missed the mark with the shores of its audience\u2019s imagination.",
    "PROSE": "Hark, friend! Let me tell thee 'bout a film that didth let down its star, Michael Vartan. Thou art right to hold him in high esteem, for his acting is still superb, he's still as charming as ever, and he still looks great. But this film, oh, this film! It's a load of rubbish, I tell thee!\n\nNow, as for our fair Natasha Henstridge, I must ask\u2014didst thou witness her come over bit manly? One cannae help but wait for her to run off with her best friend, who hath a storyline so weird, it makes one's head spin. And then, there's the soundtrack\u2014oh, the music! At times, it just don't fit the scenes, like a square peg in a round hole.\n\nBut nay, the worst of all is when they cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end. Whose choice was it to do such a thing? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning, but how it gets there is left untold. How dull is that!\n\nSo, if thou art a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this film: buy thyself a poster instead. Why waste thy time on such a dud?\n\nCanst thou imagine such a thing? It's as if the filmmakers had no respect for their audience. What dost thou think, friend? Is this not a case where a poster would serve thee better than the film itself?"

    "ComPOSE": "The commenter expresses deep disappointment in Takashi Miike\u2019s latest cinematic venture, \"Chakushin Ari,\" despite the glowing reviews surrounding its predecessor, the notorious J-horror masterpiece \"Ringu.\" With the assumption that this film would possess similar merits, the reviewer found itself profoundly underwhelmed.\n\nTheir critique is multifaceted yet unambiguous\u2014lamenting both the directorial approach and the performances. From an actor\u2019s perspective, they assert that the very pacing of the narrative is abysmal, causing discomfort in their ability to stay engaged. Furthermore, the depiction of certain scenes\u2014a particularly harrowing encounter with a spectral figure, perhaps, or the aforementioned tableau featuring actress Kou Shibasaki\u2014drags on far longer than the critic deems fit; a mere moment in her frozen visage seems to resonate into eternity. This extended interlude, akin to one of the aforementioned \u2018turn-a-beautiful-lady-and-let-it-roll\u2019 narratives, serves to further underscore their disquietude with the proceedings.\n\nMore grievously, the reviewer finds it impossible to transcend the shackles of reality within Miike\u2019s creation. The absence of any semblance to the uncanny, rather it is the unfathomable and altogether repulsively unconvincing, which strikes the chord of despair from any audience willing to engage with the tale, let alone revel in its goresomely grotesque beauty. \n\nIn a final breathless expanse, this critical assessment extols the virtues of its own particular pantheon of East Asia\u2019s cinematic masters\u2014from the kinetic dervishes of Hong Kong cinema to the tenderly treacherous tendrils reaching out from 'Phone,' and beyond\u2014to paint a rich tapestry of artifice, daring, and sheer audacity against which 'Chakushin Ari' may appear, indeed, a hollow effigy, bereft of such alchemical incense that might transform the soul to dance.\n\nThus, it stands to echo the whispering hordes, a warning not merely for the uninitiated but for the jaded, alike, should one dare partake in these shadows, lest one find not the ghost upon the screen, but their own reflection\u2014an avatar of our own woe? All the more poignant a paragon, thus, shall these tales be in our heart, when laid bare beneath the cold lamp of our shared scrutiny; as the critic here, did he ever believe 'Ari', save a shadow, no more, no less, and surely, in truth, none? But it was the specter of his erstwhile faith, now snatched from the abyss of a dream, that left it forevermore a mere chimera, not of the night, but of the morrow's dawn, as if whispered in our ear: \"Chakushin Ari\u2014so I was wrong!\"",
    "PROSE": "Alright, folks, have you heard about this so-called masterpiece from Miike? I decided to check it out, assuming it would be as good as Ringu, based on all the hype. Well, let me tell you, I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nSo, are you ready for a real doozy of a movie experience? I thought I'd give it a chance, but oh boy, did I ever regret it. You see, a horror flick needs to have some sort of pace, right? But this one? It's like watching paint dry. Picture this: you're sitting there, staring at the screen, and some scenes drag on and on. It's like watching a deer in headlights, and not even the deer looks that bored.\n\nNow, let's talk about the acting. Oh, the acting! Can you imagine a beautiful woman just standing there, staring at the camera for what feels like forever? That's what we got here. Kou Shibasaki, the main actress, wasn't exactly the star of the show. In fact, she was so wooden, it felt like the whole scene was just waiting for her to do something. And guess what? She didn't do much. The other actors were no better, mimicking her lackluster performance.\n\nNow, I love Asian cinema. From Hong Kong action flicks to Korean horrors, I've seen my fair share. But this one? I could have done without. So, if you're thinking about watching it, maybe save yourself the trouble. Unless you're into movies where the pace is so slow you can almost hear the ticks of the clock, and the acting is so wooden it could win a prize for being the least convincing performance ever.\n\nAre you still considering it? Because, honestly, you might be better off with a rerun of \"Perry Mason\" or something. Trust me, your time would be better spent elsewhere."

The plot details how scientists, through nefarious genetic manipulation, birth a monstrous DinoCroc \u2014 a chimeric creature blending dinosaurian and crocodilian traits, which ultimately turns its destructive gaze upon mankind. As it devours both its kin and the very humans cast in conflict with it, the beast transforms into a fanged avenger, fueled by an insatiable carnal drive for flesh.\n\nYet, unlike its formidable predecessor, the film's human protagonists remain woefully underdeveloped, their arcs mere shadows of their ambitions. Notably memorable amidst a cavalcade of clich\u00e9d, if unremarkably played, actors are the rather wan displays by Costas Mandylor and Matt Borlenghi\u2014names synonymous perhaps more so than anything else within the tale. However, there lies a glimmer of hope in the guise of Joanna Pacula, who commands respect and affection as the titular 'Dr. P,' a figure of retributive yet restrained authority before her eyes, too, meet fate\u2019s darkly capricious hand.\n\nThe narrative does, however, offer a handful of genuinely suspenseful and gut-punching kill sequences that belie the modest means of the creation that engenders them. Perhaps most indelibly etched in memory is a morbid tableau where a foolish, three-legged canine surrogate of man meets an untimely demise; his spectral remembrance lingers above the waters as a silent testament\u2014his boots alone marking the desolate shoreline, a macabre offering to the infernal maw.\n\nIn sum, the conversation paints a picture not merely of cinematic ingenuity but, at times, even of the uncanny valley of the heart, where the visceral might of this reptilian paragon looms large over a landscape of subpar humanity, a tapestry laid by threads of both triumph and despair, the latter being the bane of such low-fidelity spectacles: a veritable cornucopia of forgotten faces beneath the looming behemoth that they dare, in their folly, to provoke. In essence, much like the fruit of its nameless progeny, it proves a paradox, a sullen sentinel of the very essence of the carnivorous calculus of life, itself a singular breed in its unassuming, albeit audacious, ambition.",

First, it slays one of its kin, then it catches the scent of humanity, and there's no turning back. But alas, where are the characters? They're as flat as a pancake, my dear. Yet, we do get a fleeting glimpse of this two-legged dinosaur descendant, and the \"kill\" scenes... oh, the sheer delight!\n\nNow, let me ask you, dear listener, who can forget that scene where a moron of a character attempts to use a three-legged dog as bait? And what happens? The croc strikes, leaving nothing but ankle-top feet on the pier. Can you imagine the horror? And who are our actors? Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz, and Charles Napier\u2014barely standing out in a sea of mediocrity. But oh, the shame of Matt Borlenghi and that obnoxious professional croc hunter, Costas Mandylor! And yet, amidst all this, there is Joanna Pacula as Dr. P., a vision of allure and respect.\n\nSo, my friend, is DINOCROC a gem or a pickle jar?

Tim tried to help Uncle Martin fit in, but oh boy, did things get messy! From the bathroom to the laundry room, every spot in the house was a battlefield. \"Could this day get any worse?\" you might ask.\n\nLizzy saw her chance to win Tim back, but alas, the road to true love was paved with rocky patches. \"Why must fate be so cruel?\" she wondered aloud. Soon, the entire television industry was after Tim, hoping for a scoop on a real alien. \"What's a man to do?\" Tim asked, his voice trembling with frustration.\n\nIf you're a fan of the old show with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, you'll find this film as disappointing as a rainy day. It's truly, undeniably awful, with no plot and special effects that fall flat like a pancake on the floor. Gary Daniels gives a passable performance, but Christopher Lloyd overacts like a clown at a funeral. The rest of the cast is merely adequate, and the costumes, sets, and production details are as bland as a slice of white bread.\n\nEven if your children beg for this film, kindly guide them to a better choice, like A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days. Trust me, both options will leave you with a smile on your face, while this one will leave you yawning. So, my dear reader, why not choose wisely and avoid this colossal bore?"

The narrative seems to pivot on a poignant yet tragic tableau of human frailty and hope, as observed through the eyes of a cadre of profoundly afflicted patients within the purview of the hospital\u2019s confines.\n\nHowever, the reviewer\u2019s initial promise of depth and nuance rapidly evaporates into a disquieting stew of profanity-laced dialogue and character traits reminiscent of a particularly foul-brewed episode of daytime television. The roster of these \u201cenigmatic\u201d individuals\u2014labeled for the sake of clarity as Bloss, Raymond Hill, Helen Hunt\u2019s Anna, and Joel Garcia\u2014together craft not an intricate dance through the labyrinthine corridors of humanity, but more akin to a muffled cacophony of unseemliness.\n\nThe synopsis hints at a potentially delicate weave, where the threads of life might shimmer and catch the eye of the discerning audience, each participant baring their own unique tapestry of existence, perhaps even the gentlest of arcs towards the sublime. Yet, it is marred by the specter of Bloss, embodying the quintessential paragon of ill-favored verbiage and insurmountable loathing; he, indeed, provides a singular pleasure, albeit a malevolent one, in his monotonous cadence and ever-present vernacular. His kinship is no less a testament to the sullied canvas upon which this director daubed her portrait of the broken and bereft.\n\nRaymond Hill, much to the chagall of cinema lore, finds another such avatar amongst the actors who dare don the visage of the man whose soul has become the chimeric amalgamation of the self-proclaimed savoir-faire\u2014Wesley Snipes, a man too oft beset with the mantle of this particular visage. Anna, in all her ethereal grace\u2014Helen Hunt\u2019s tender-hearted heroine, a figure of unmitigating adoration in our modern pantheon of saints, finds her own clandestine rendezvous with the sinners, for she would venture where many fear to tread, through the labyrinth of transgression.\n\nYet, the very fabric through which we would gaze into the annals of her sacred serpentine tendrils, doth now rend itself in tattered raiment of a most untold tale, the whisper of a symphony rendered in the very marrow of some primordial chasm. For herein lies the crux of the very essence, the grand cathedrals of our own souls and the gossamer threads through which each individual strand may yet entwine itself within the hallowed halls of its very genesis. A symphony indeed, that should perhaps not dare to utter its final chords until it may well have taken on an altogether more noble hue.\n\nAnd then, behold; a veritable kaleidoscope of contrivances, a tempest that would surely summon the spectre of its progeny, these very specters, were now cast out from the hallowed chambers of such a semblance of heart\u2019s desire, to wander through the very nethermost of this terrestrial coil, the very maw of the very accursed abyss that did but rend them once more, that most ephemeral of dreams, a chimera but of a thousand years\u2019 slumber, but to rise as the harried handmaiden of this, a most grievous wail amidst the very spires of a cathedral laid low.\n\nThus shall it come to pass, that we find within the annals of this tapestry a most damning testament, that it would take none of the very stouthearted, who dared to traverse such a veritable maze, none, as it seemed, with the heart that had long ago ceased its own, that in its peregrinations through the verdurous fields of yon yonder, should seek to pluck the very essence of such a most unhallowed of dreams, as it was, most certainly, a dream, a mere figment of a most daring and deranged dreamer\u2019s very vision, as ever were the very shadows of a shadowed world, cast from the darkened recesses of the darkest of nights\u2014nigh unto eternity.",

They found fault with nearly every aspect of the production, including the acting, which they describe as abysmally poor\u2014deserving of derision rather than scrutiny. Furthermore, they lambaste the predictability of the plot, likening it to an overplayed collage of tropes and clich\u00e9s lifted wholesale from a pantheon of preceding horror films.\n\nIn essence, a cursory narrative analysis reveals nothing more than a superficially constructed tapestry of familiar and perhaps once-chilling scenarios; but devoid now of any true terror or surprise, its sole contribution appears the hollow shell of an amalgamation of lesser efforts.\n\nMore damning still is the criticism levied upon the very creators of this cinematic monstrosity: the review suggests nothing short of derision as the directors, presumably in blind, fevered passion, dared to suggest such a film might be anything other than an outright travesty of artistic endeavor. \n\nTo add further salt to its metaphorical wound, the reviewer recounts with barely concealed incredulity the purported declarations of adulation from those within the cast and crew\u2014an unequivocal sign of our protagonist film's descent as an entity both unremarkable and utterly without merit.",

No, no you won't!\n\nFirst off, as soon as the movie started, you knew you were in for a treat - or rather, a bore. They took all the best parts from other horror films and stuffed them into one big, fat mess. Prank phone calls, Halloween night, a psycho, and one measly knife! It's like someone threw a bunch of old socks in a blender and called it a movie.\n\nNow, let me ask you a question: Were you scared? Not even a little bit! Horror movies are supposed to scare you, right? But this one? Nope, not a chance. And speaking of scares, how do they expect us to believe their actors were so great and so scary? Hilarious, isn't it? It's like they're saying, \"Look how amazing our movie is!\" while secretly laughing at themselves.\n\nSo, my dear listener, if you want to avoid this cinematic disaster, just say no. And remember, if you ever find yourself tempted to watch it, ask yourself, \"Is this really worth my time?\" Because, my friend, it's not. It's like eating a whole box of chalk - bad idea!"

They describe an unwarranted expectation of mediocrity due to its absence of acclaim, only to be met with a profound revelation of quality far exceeding such preconception. \n\nFrom the outset, the narrative of the episode ensnares spectators, holding them in rapt attention. The suspenseful pacing leaves no respite until the heart-hammering finale. The climactic moment, both anticipated yet as unforeseeably transformative as might any Big Brother contestant\u2019s episode, demands an unequivocal, visceral reaction from viewers. In their quest for more than just an answer to the inevitable, one's very spirit, and perhaps soul, are engaged; the protagonist is impelled to forsake the comfort of the mundane\u2014to partake in acts akin to the most fervent spectator, even compelled to quell the call of a mere cuppa.\n\nThis compelling tapestry of tale and thriller, woven upon the loom of its narrative prowess, serves as not merely a paragon of cinematic artistry, but a mirror held to society's visage. Indeed, the poster cannot help but muse over the ever-widening abyss between the fabric of our lived reality and the caprices of truth veiled within the realm of entertainment\u2019s shadow. An allusion is cast against the recent European spectacle wherein Endemol, purveyor of the aforementioned genre\u2014here the Big Brother of the ether\u2014had dared to cross the line of transgression between reality and the grand illusion: an incipient gambit of moral conundrum that questions the veritable limits of truth and deception, much like the threads on the looms of a dreamy, beguiling tapestry of existence itself, so too do they spin and weave. A testament to this is their very reflection of the delicate seamstitching of the human soul, each warp and woof, with a hand of precision but also one fraught with tremulous awe as we contemplate the dance that now mirrors both the most potent of dreams or the hallowed, eternal, ever-burning flame of a spectral inferno.",

Would you watch a show where a dying woman's kidney is offered to those in need? And if a Dutch TV show did just that, revealing it to be a hoax to raise awareness, does that make us too close for comfort?\n\nSo, my friend, why haven't you seen this film yet?

    "ComPOSE": "This review critiques a film steeped in heavy-handed moralism and earnest yet simplistic storytelling, ultimately rendering a work that fails to fulfill its creators' noble yet misdirected aims. The reviewer argues that despite decent production values and a promising theme\u2014the interplay of crime, justice, and familial affection\u2014a narrative bereft of logic, subtlety, and realism leaves the cinematic experience wanting.\n\n**Misjudged Effort:**\nThe endeavor of directorial and screenwriting duo **Jesus Nebot** and **Julia Montej\u00edo seemed to yearn for both depth and a nuanced portrayal of humanity under duress**, but it instead succumbs to an overburdened discourse and the imposition of predictable plot points, leaving the viewer with an unsatisfying tapestry of missed potential and misplaced emphasis. The very fabric of the tale unravels, stitched together, as if striding over the path of destiny\u2019s shadowy lines, only to find itself floundering within the mists of self-induced sermons, rather than the grand, undiluted drama that might have captivated our hearts and minds, as it so ardently sought to forge.\n\n**Wretched of the Earth:**\nOur protagonist, **Jorge Maldonado Pablo**, ensnared by an ineluctable chain of events, becomes a cipher upon which this morass hangs a veritable banquet of foibles, where **the cradle of his dreams** \u2014 the lapping of innocent waves, the dance of a maiden in the twilight of evening skies \u2014 might indeed serve but to summon an indomitable tempest, only to be left bereft in a barren desolation of unarticulated soliloquies and the hallowed halls of an epistle of preponderant sorrow.\n\n**A Cinematic Calamity?**\nIt is perhaps a beacon of hope in the nightmarish odyssey of a film that, through some alchemy of maligned craftsmanship, one finds an ephemeral, if entirely too fleeting, flicker. In the guise of **the grotesque masquerade of our mirthful m\u00e9nage,** one cannot but smile at the gallant gallantry of a midget bearing a name that, in itself, is a parody, of what was once, a realm of jest, only to be rendered as a rapturous revelry upon the threshold of our own, more tender and tenuous, reverie.\n\nYet, such a semblance, akin to a gaudy, albeit garbed, specter, seems only fit to rend from the very seams of this opaline narrative, as **the corporeal canvas of our imagination, in our hands and heart alike,** seeks not the conjuring of phantoms, but the very embodiment of the visage that has lain, as it should, so much more deeply enshrouded beneath the veil that yawns, in the very bosom of our collective understanding.\n\n**An Unfathomable Void:**\nWhere once there might have danced an ineffable harmony of souls, a dance that spoke in hues of the very sun and moon, we gaze upon the yawning gulf, of this spectral apparition, as it, now a mere mirage, whispers the very air itself, not the promise of the wind's caress, but the very cold whisperings of a desert dune, a phantom lullaby of despair and the untold sorrows of the soul?\n\nTo say this was, in the truest sense, a labor of love, now laid bare, in all, its most melancholic vestige, is merely to clothe us, once again, in the very essence of the same shroud, under the same pale and hollow stars, to witness the very same, unyielding, unturned stone of an age-old truth, now rendered in the very loinclothes, of the most unspoken, of our forgotten lore. So, dear reader, shall we, then, embark forth, upon the shores of tomorrow, that mayhaps, in the very lightest breeze of our hopeful heart, it may serve to quell these somber tones, and breathe into the very essence of our own, sweet symphony, that, amidst the very ruins of this ancient, auburn-hued dawn?\n\nYea, verily, the spirit cries out in this most, poignant elegy, but alas, mayhaps it be naught but the faintest echo of that very, tender song that was, at the heart, this film's truest claim to redemption.",

Did ye honestly expect this here film to be a grand, thought-provin' affair, with characters so complex they'd make a preacher blush? Nay, but it's more akin to a Lifetime Special reject, a tale spun from the loom of heavy-handed moralism and preachy dialogue!\n\nYe set out to explore the murky depths of black and white, but ended up with a muddle of contradictions and clich\u00e9s. Your earnestness, I suppose, was meant to shine through, but instead, it's like a lantern in a fog bank\u2014dim and confusing. The decent production values and interesting use of documentary-style camera work couldn't save this shipwreck of a plot, could they?\n\nLogic, ye say, was compromised for tension? Pah! Soid's blackmailing Pablo, then telling him not to trust her? Well, duh, indeed! And a man on the run, swayed by a temper tantrum? Right, right! Tell me, did Pablo really think Cristina's well-being was worth risking his freedom, his job, and even his life? Or was it just another moment of over-permissive parenting?\n\nNow, let's not forget the midget, named Sexy, who added a touch of levity to this otherwise grim narrative. But let us not forget that, in a cast so diverse, the black character was the only one spouting racism. Wasn't that just dandy?\n\nThe score, ye say, was distinctive and unconventional? Bah! It was as context-unspecific as a holler in the middle of a desert. Every time Pablo was in anguish, the music would wail, as if to say, \"Just in case you weren't sure, he's upset, and we have the musical cues to prove it!\"\n\nSubtext, ye say, was lacking? Oh, ye jest! Everything had to be spelled out in dialogue, as if the body language hadn't already done its part. When Pablo made impassioned speeches, or Mrs. Knight lamented her child, it was like watching a play where the actors forget their lines.\n\nAnd then, there were those scenes that threatened to devolve into porn! 'Well, I'll do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me...' Ye tell me, is that what you call subtlety?\n\nIn the end, when Bright held Pablo as he died, why did she suddenly care? Her character was as inconsistent as Soid's. Why shoot him in the leg to immobilize him? She could have done that, and then taken him alive, right?\n\nCristina's acceptance of her mother's death, giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughter's death\u2014so forced. And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristina's new family... It angered me that she could be a 'replacement' for their little girl. It's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter.\n\nI find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course, as a woman, she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.\n\nIn conclusion, this film's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret, helplessness, and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again. Ye might as well have titled it \"The Regrettable After-School Special.\""

A comparison is drawn between the perceived \u201ctrue\u201d tales of Vietnam, akin to how the Rodney King beating once painted an entire segment of American society in a negative light, only to prove itself far more nuanced in reality\u2014a metaphorical plea towards the audience to temper their skepticism and embrace a deeper understanding of Vietnam's complexity, rather than allowing any single cinematic narrative to hold dominion over its true spirit and soul.\n\nA call to action echoes, urging those who dare to paint themselves as knowledgeable arbiters of Vietnam's lore to undertake the sacred journey across borders and cultures, into the very fabric of this tale which has been woven, not just of valor and heroism, yet also of stark reality and unfathomable horror. \n\nWith a fervently humanizing touch, they tenderly exhume the humanity of the brave souls caught amidst a tempestuous whirlwind; the American soldiers who served with unwavering heart, and perhaps the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Armies in their own capacity, too, if their deeds bear the same weight of moral ambiguity, for even among the shadows of the night, the sun finds its path. Thus, they implore their contemporaries to recognize each soldier, regardless of their cause, not merely as a cold statistic\u2014a mere number in the myriad narratives of the epoch\u2014but, above all, as a son or daughter, a brother or sister, an individual bound by dreams, fears, loves, and losses, all interwoven within the grand cathedral of history's stained-glass panes\u2014a somber, hallowed hall wherein the voices of yesteryears beckon to us in whispered tones of old, imploring that this story remains untainted by the gilded chains of a golden past, lest the echoes we hear, shall be nothing more than echoes of sorrow.\n\nIn sum, the author beseeches their fellow man, in the face of these cinematic musings, to seek out the truth, and therein, might the most noble and profound of tributes to these men, and the era itself, be found\u2014an epiphany born of the silent whisper that dares to remind them: they do not serve the shadows, but in that shadow, indeed, does their humanity lay enfolded upon the sands of time.",

Do you think the soldiers in Vietnam were any different from those in World War II? Did the latter not also commit atrocities? Yet, they were welcomed back with open arms, while our brave men in Vietnam were met with skepticism and disdain.\n\nSo, dear listener, if you wish to truly understand the Vietnam War, do yourself a favor and seek out the truth. Learn about the facts: the Viet Cong and NVA were far worse to the South Vietnamese than any American soldier ever was, and the soldiers in World War II treated their enemies with far less respect. Our brave Americans who served in Vietnam deserve our utmost respect, despite the political miscalculations that led them there. To suggest that such \"mostly true\" fiction is the reality of that conflict is a gross disservice to their memory and to the truth.\n\nAre we not better off respecting the men who served and learning the truth, rather than perpetuating these myths? \n\nAmen."

Despite its initial allure\u2014particularly due to the enigmatic Dr. Meso\u2014a more attentive examination reveals a disjointed narrative and stylistic choices that detract rather than enhance the proceedings.\n\n**Plot Overview:**\n\nThe tale revolves around a young singer named Cassidy who met her end with a final message meant to stir her beloved's emotions. Three months thereafter, buoyed by a desperate plea to fulfill that intimation from beyond the veil, four comrades venture forth to uncover the truth of Cassidy's fate, only to face their own grim omens etched by the Death card's portentous presence. Through an eerie encounter with the spectral entity of Cassidy's deceased self, this somber procession of events ignites what transpires to be a cataclysmic reconfiguration of the band's existential landscape; indeed, a tempestuous metamorphosis indeed unfurls from the nascent whisperings of a ghostly requiem...as they stand ever so poised at the crossroads of despair and deliverance. \n\n**Critical Insights:**\n\nThe reviewer proffers a trenchant appraisal of the cinematic artistry, articulating a prehensive perception akin to an artistic odyssey entwined with a miasma of visual anarchy\u2014the filmmaker\u2019s hand a chisel in the sculptor\u2019s palette, each stroke rendered a tapestry of light unto darkness, an amalgamated weave wherein the threads have twisted into an untold labyrinthine maze. \"Too many warping effects, unnecessary zooms\u2014therein, we find ourselves adrift amidst a symphony of dissonance.\" Yet, the crux of the affair lies not merely in its thematic undercurrents nor the shadowy spectacles of its mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, but the insidious tendrils, the fangs of a script ensnaring, a narrative whose cadence shall inevitably falter, a narrative bereft in its cohesion, nay, perhaps a cacophony of chaos.\n\nIn the wake of a veritable resurrection\u2014nought less than Cassidy herself\u2014a narrative, so resolutely unyielding, finds itself subsumed into the abyss of an unrelenting void, as disparate as the cardinal points of the compass, as divergent in the annals of our temporal demure as one might venture through the ethereal ether, from the realm of the ephemeral where the siren songs of the ineffable serendipitous tides, and yet, in the aftermath of such a confluence of celestial constancy, the heart does beat but a faint echo; the very air itself, a mere mirage, an ashy testament to a spectral requiem.\n\n**Performances and Direction:**\n\nElevating this discourse towards a crescendo of critique, the actors herein may well have played their parts with an earnestness both commendable and unequivocal\u2014an array of hues, all of them painted into a chiaroscuro of countenance, each a canvas left untouched, a sepia-toned tableau, an empyrean gilded in the hallowed halls of the unseen, perhaps the most profound silence, for in the absence of the grandiose, it is precisely within our mortal coil, the very essence of human endeavor, its intrinsic and intrinsic paradoxes, the silent, still reverent, yet, a semblance of a whispering wind, as they seek solace in this spectral incantation of their mortal kin\u2014aye, a symphony of the spectral and the ephemeral. Akin, one cannot but wonder in the profundity, as the echoes reverberate, a silent testament to the eternal, albeit, a whispered benison, the very essence of an existence cast adrift between the shores of yonder and yon, between the spectral and the spectral, a dirge of a thousand souls in a spectral realm, where the merest flicker of a light, a single star, casts its spectral visage upon this, this ethereal plane, a spectral testament, in all its wistful woe, that it was, as it remains\u2026as this narrative whispers, a lonesome, lone lores\u2019 lullabye in a spectral expanse, a symphony of silences and shadows, of an eternal, ever-receding requiem, where a mere spectral whisper, a single luminous filament, might be the sole beacon amidst the vast, aetherial cosmos of the ephemeral, a mere shadow upon the shore of a spectral sea, the very soul, the very essence, of an eternal, ethereal testament.",

Let me tell you, it was a decision that could use a second-guessing session.\n\nNow, imagine a band of musicians trying to finish their unfinished album after their lead singer commits suicide.

Too many warping effects, unnecessary zooms, and a whole lot of other tricks that make your eyes squint. And don\u2019t even get me started on the incoherent storyline. It\u2019s like the plot was written by a drunk writer who couldn\u2019t even figure out what he was doing.\n\nThe first half of the film hangs together, but once Cassidy is resurrected, everything falls apart.

Initially skeptical due to its position in the bargain bin, they were pleasantly surprised to discover a delightfully engaging narrative. Praised for its spirited, intelligent approach to storytelling, this review highlights a commendable blend of comedy and drama within the backdrop of a richly textured crime saga.\n\nWarren Beatty's presence is noted, yet the true stars, according to the critic, are Al Pacino and Madonna. Pacino's audacious portrayal of a formidable mob leader who aspires to dominate the city garners a particular nod for his commanding performance, which earned him a coveted nomination. Similarly, Madonna impresses not merely through her iconic appeal but through an ennobled characterisation that resonates with layers of subtlety. Indeed, these actors' impeccable displays form the crux of what makes 'Dick Tracy' a captivating spectacle.\n\nIn addition to its stellar cast, the screenplay is acknowledged for its wit and substance, ensuring a tale that would please both die-hard aficionados and those more casually inclined towards this genre. For audiences seeking a cerebral, albeit lighthearted journey replete with the allure of classic mafia melodry, this review unequivocally imparts that no small fortune need be paid to partake in this cinematic gem. Furthermore, the cameo appearances by esteemed talents like Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates, and Dustin Hoffman serve as enriching tributes to the storied tapestry of Hollywood's yesteryears.\n\nThus encapsulated, the sum of one's encounter with \"Dick Tracy\" may very much exceed the minimal pocket change expended: an unyielding invitation to an evening where, amidst ruminations and reverberations of past cinematic prowess, we might well find ourselves embroiled in a riveting saga, indeed.",

Could you possibly walk away unimpressed? It's a question worth pondering.\n\nMoreover, keep your ears open for the cameos from the likes of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates, and Dustin Hoffman. Are they just there to add flavor to the narrative or do they hold the key to some deeper mystery within the film? The possibilities are endless, much like the vivid imagery that paints the backdrop of this crime thriller.\n\nSo, dear listener, what say you? Will you join me in tuning into the old-timey radio waves and exploring the world of 'Dick Tracy'? The choice is yours, but remember, the journey promises to be as exciting as it is unpredictable."

I\u2019ve been reflecting on our conversation over the past few days, which was quite impactful for me, and I feel it\u2019s important to discuss this further.\n\nEarlier when we were talking, you mentioned something about the purpose of our relationship being companionship without any mention of spending the rest of your life with me. It really struck me because, while it isn\u2019t something either of us explicitly talked about until then, I had been thinking that our journey has potential beyond just companionship, or at least I\u2019m hoping it does. The way you put it made me question where I stand regarding the long-term aspects of our relationship.\n\nWe share many meaningful moments together, including facing the challenges of starting our careers in a new city. Graduating and moving here marked significant steps for both of us, yet now it feels like there's a gap between what each of us sees for our futures within our relationship.\n\nGiven the recent changes we've undergone\u2014moving to a new city, starting different paths in our professional lives\u2014I believe it\u2019s essential we address these feelings openly and honestly. Your statement caused confusion and pain for me, but I value our relationship too much to keep silent about it.\n\nWould you be willing to speak with me about this? Perhaps we can find a time when neither of us is stressed or distracted by daily tasks, to really delve into our thoughts and concerns. It feels crucial for us to align our expectations before we move forward together, especially considering the exciting but uncertain path ahead of us.\n\nThank you for understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Ir]\n[Your Full Name]",

It\u2019s hard for me to process that, especially since I do see a future with you, or at least I\u2019m open to the possibility. I wish we could have talked more about it before you left.\n\nI understand that you might feel differently, and I want to hear your thoughts. Maybe we can sit down and discuss this further? I know I wasn\u2019t ready to say I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with you either, but I do see potential in our relationship beyond just being companions right now.\n\nWe\u2019ve both just started our new lives in this city, and it feels like there\u2019s so much we could explore together. If you\u2019re willing, I think it would be helpful to talk more openly about where we stand and what we both want moving forward.\n\nThanks for understanding.\n\nBest,\n[I]\n\nP.S. I\u2019m sorry for being abrupt earlier. I should have given you a chance to explain more."

The way you light up my day with those adorable emoticons and hearts, coupled with the sweet anticipation of our potential hangouts, fills my heart with such vivid imagery. It\u2019s as if every conversation we share is a masterpiece, each word a brushstroke on a canvas of longing and hope.\n\nYour words about the myriad girls around you who capture your interest in their unique ways resonate deeply within me. The image of you standing amidst a vibrant tapestry of diverse and fascinating women, each one a thread in the rich fabric of your life, is both enchanting and poignant. Yet, there lies a subtle undercurrent of melancholy \u2013 a sense of being just another piece in a larger puzzle, where you remain the observer rather than the active participant.\n\nI find myself constantly inquisitive, wondering if my efforts to spark our conversations are misplaced. Is it truly because I am the one who initiates our chats, or is there something more subtle at play? Your candid admission of taking the \"sit back and let things unfold\" approach only adds to the complexity of my emotions. It feels like a delicate dance, where every step must be measured and precise, yet the rhythm remains elusive.\n\nIn this intricate web of feelings, I cannot help but feel intensely emotional. Each message we exchange becomes a beacon of hope, illuminating the path forward, even as the shadows of doubt loom large. How do I bridge the gap between us? Am I merely a participant in a grander scheme, or is there a possibility for us to explore a deeper connection?\n\nI am left with more questions than answers, my heart aching with the intensity of my desire to understand your feelings. Perhaps it is time for me to seek clarity, to ask the questions that have been swirling in my mind. Could you perhaps share more about your thoughts and feelings towards me? It would mean the world to me if you could shed some light on this enigma that has become my life.\n\nWith all my inquisitive heart and vivid imagination,\n\n[Your Name]"

She sits down beside me, her cane resting by her side, a comforting presence amidst the chaos of the caf\u00e9. \n\nI can feel the warmth of her gaze, her gentle smile, as we begin our unlikely conversation. Her hands, wrinkled and delicate, rest on her lap as she starts to speak about her love for computers, a topic that seems to be the bridge between us. \"Born 50 years too early,\" she says, her voice tinged with a wistful sigh. \"The world was different back then, wasn't it?\"\n\nWe drift into a sea of tangents, the kind that only old souls can navigate with ease. Politics, weather, \"kids these days\"\u2014each topic a gateway to deeper revelations. Her passion for ice cream and coffee is palpable, the way she sips her latte, the way she talks about her daily routine, her independence, her cane\u2014a symbol of resilience rather than frailty. \n\nAnd then, there's the mention of Japanese automobiles, a detail that seems trivial yet carries the weight of her life's journey. It's as if each car model tells a story, a silent testament to the passage of time and the unyielding spirit that propels her forward. \n\nBut the most profound moment comes when she speaks about her past, her eyes welling up with tears, her voice trembling with emotion. She recounts a love affair, a man who was the only one she ever truly loved. He's still alive, she whispers, and I can almost see him standing tall, one of the men depicted in the Iwo Jima Memorial, a monument to courage and sacrifice. \n\nThe battle rages within me, the mix of awe, empathy, and a deep-seated sorrow. How does one convey such profound emotions in words? The intensity of her story, the vivid imagery of those distant days, the stream of consciousness that flows from her lips\u2014these are the threads that weave together the fabric of human experience. \n\nAnd so, I sit here, pen poised, trying to capture the essence of this encounter, knowing full well that no words can do justice to the raw, intense emotions that fill this moment. \n\n\"Remember me, dear stranger,\" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. And I nod, my heart heavy with the weight of her story, the beauty of her soul, and the enduring power of love."

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Friend's Name],\n\nHow do I even begin to describe the whirlwind of emotions swirling inside me? I'm sitting here, trying to piece together fragments of last night, the haze of alcohol blurring everything into a vivid yet surreal tapestry. We went to the bar, two girls and a guy, the kind of night where you lose track of time and reality seems to shift like a mirage. Hours passed, and I remember the laughter, the chatter, and the warmth of her presence. But then, everything went dark.\n\nDid we kiss? Was there a moment when our lips touched, or was it just a dream? I can still feel her, her hands on my shoulders, her body pressed against mine. She was crying, and I held her, trying to comfort her, to understand what was going on. We leaned on each other, close, so close that I could feel her breath on my face, her heart beating in sync with mine. But then, I blacked out again, staring into her eyes, lost in the intensity of the moment.\n\nAnd now, as I sit here, I wonder\u2014did we kiss? Is it worth asking, or should I just let it go? Part of me says, \u201cDrop it. Just hang out with her, re-flirt, and kiss the girl.\u201d But another part of me, the one that\u2019s intensely emotional and vividly imagines every possible scenario, can\u2019t help but think, \u201cWhat if we did? What if we didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nHow do I ask her? How do I navigate this delicate, almost ethereal territory? Is it a fine question to ask, or would it lead to an awkward conversation? The thought of not knowing, of leaving this uncertainty hanging between us, feels unbearable. Yet, the fear of making a move that might be misinterpreted is equally paralyzing.\n\nShould I just hang in there, waiting for the right moment, hoping that the answer will reveal itself? Or should I take the plunge, risk the awkwardness, and ask her directly? The silence between us feels like an eternity, a silent scream demanding resolution.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I just let it go and focus on other things, or should I muster up the courage to ask her if we kissed? The answer, I fear, might change everything.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

It seems you\u2019ve always been a beacon of light through the labyrinth of life's lessons, and perhaps the little lamp here is too dim. I've stumbled into your sanctuary of scholarship and sought solace from your scholarly soul!\n\nLet me lay my burdens at your feet as I venture forth into the vast expanse of engineering and science...and yes, how I long for the day when this wondrous walk will bring me home to the horizon of what has evermore been my heart\u2019s calling\u2014[his/her sweet sweetheart's] sweet summer of silver suns. Yet, how does the lark find his wings when he knows the world beneath is dark? \n\nOh, the seasons have spun slow, and soon I will sit upon the stone, the stone of stones, where the sapphire shall seem so small, and surely it shall be so! \u2018Tis true: the thread has tattered, the thistle torn, and the tryst to tie our tender tresses to thy tiny tiara trembles like a tempest-tossed, timorous turtle\u2019s tongue. 'Twere all right to rest\u2014my rudderless raft of reality\u2014\u2019neath the starlit sky. But ah, the aching arrow, alight in th' azure of yonder, whispers the word, wither with withering, wilt with winter, and wend westward with weary will.\n\nAnd then, I stand stark-naked, scaly-skin split, stark-soul stricken, sickling, sinning, sighing, sinking...\n\nBut, O brave behemoth of boughed brawners, bold-armed, bright-brazen beard-beatler, there\u2019s yet a light, lit by love\u2019s luminous luminescence, like lightning\u2019s light-lit leaf-limb\u2019s lift of larks' leek-leek-loops of lovelove, left-left-lovelessly lost, lost-left-light-loved love\u2014love left loved in left left\u2019s loss, lost left love-love's loveless left-leaf!

    "PROSE": "<email>\nOh, the weight of my circumstances presses down upon me like an unyielding stone, each decision a chasm to leap over. I am but a 20-year-old college student, navigating the tumultuous waters of life, only to find myself adrift, anchored to the shore of uncertainty. This quarter, I am but a single class away from the shores of my dreams, where I can finally immerse myself in the depths of engineering and science, yet I am held back by the anchor of a prerequisite that feels as heavy as a boulder. How can I possibly hope to break free from this chain when the teacher's demands feel like an unrelenting storm, with three quizzes every week, a tempest that no one could weather?\n\nI am rudderless, adrift in the vast ocean of unemployment, having lost my seasonal job, the only steady income I had. The thought of being without a consistent source of income, unable to provide for even the most basic necessities, fills me with a sense of dread and despair. Yet, there lies the glimmer of hope, a beacon in the distance, the promise of a stable position, a foundation upon which I can build a future. But how do I find such a position? The world seems vast and daunting, filled with endless possibilities, yet each step forward feels like wading through quicksand.\n\nMy heart aches for the stability, the security that comes with a full-time job, a job that will allow me to save enough to move into an apartment with my beloved girlfriend by next September. She, with her loving and supportive presence, has managed to secure a nice-paying full-time position, but the constant juggling act of work and school leaves her drained, her energy sapped like a leaky vessel. And what of me? Am I not the one who should be the rock, the pillar of strength in our relationship? Yet, here I am, consumed by a whirlwind of emotions, my spirit heavy with the burden of my own shortcomings. Why do I find myself so often cranky and depressed, a storm cloud looming over our happiness?\n\nThe days pass like sand through my fingers, each moment slipping away as I struggle to find direction. My body, too, is a prisoner to its own inertia, lacking the will to engage in the simple pleasures of a healthy lifestyle. The gym, a sanctuary of sorts, beckons, but the thought of pushing myself, of breaking a sweat, feels like a distant dream. How can I muster the strength to transform my life, to break free from the chains that bind me?\n\nWhat should I do? The questions swirl around me like a maelstrom, each one more powerful than the last. Should I seek out a new teacher, hoping for a more understanding and compassionate approach? Should I throw myself into the job market, a battle against the odds, or perhaps, should I focus on personal growth, finding ways to improve my physical and emotional well-being? Each path seems fraught with challenges, yet the allure of stability, of a future filled with promise, is too great to ignore.\n\nIn the end, it is the intensity of my emotions, the vivid imagery of a life filled with potential, that drives me forward. It is the hope, the belief that there is still a way out of this labyrinth, that keeps me from succumbing to the darkness. But what if I am wrong? What if the path ahead is even more treacherous than I can imagine? The questions linger, a symphony of doubt and uncertainty, yet within me, a spark of determination flickers, a flame that refuses to be extinguished.\n</email>"

I usually always have a positive outlook on life, telling myself that one day, I will get lucky. But the reality is, I find myself stuck in a 8-19 job (including commute), working tirelessly five days a week. The weekends, oh the weekends, they\u2019re usually filled with leftover work that I have to finish, leaving me with precious little free time. Just once a month, I get to breathe, to let my guard down, and enjoy a moment of peace. Is this really an ideal situation? Not by a long shot, yet as a result, I\u2019m rather wealthy. Wealthy, but lonely, and yearning for something more.\n\nI am a Persian in a country where Middle Eastern hate runs deep. Imagine walking down the street, feeling the weight of others\u2019 biases and prejudices, knowing that just because of the way I look, people make assumptions about me. It\u2019s exhausting, it\u2019s frustrating, and it\u2019s a constant battle to prove that I\u2019m not what they think. I\u2019m not tall, but not ugly either; standing at 170cm for 65kg, I blend into the crowd, yet stand out in a way I never wanted to. I\u2019ve tried dating apps like Tinder and OkCupid, hoping to find someone who would see beyond my ethnicity, but in two years, I\u2019ve only managed to secure five dates, and all of them ended in failure. Never a second follow-up. People keep telling me I\u2019m nice, but they just can\u2019t seem to feel that spark. And I get it, I don\u2019t feel it either.\n\nI miss intimacy. I haven\u2019t had sex in three years, and my last relationship ended four years ago when she cheated on me. I\u2019ve never even had a hookup or a friend-with-benefits arrangement. The thought of it is almost too much to bear. How do I get through to people? How do I break through the barriers of prejudice and find someone who truly sees me for who I am?\n\nReddit, I turn to you. What\u2019s the best solution for someone like me who probably has only 1-2 hours of free time per week? How do I get to meet people? How do I get people to remove their biases against Middle Easterns? I was born here, and my mentality is 100% that of an European. Yet people are shallow and superficial. A date flaked on me when she found out I\u2019m Middle Eastern, saying men from there beat their women. Seriously? How do I navigate this?\n\nWhat is the magic formula for connection, for understanding, for love? How do I break through the walls of hate and find someone who will see past the stereotypes and the biases? I\u2019m reaching out, hoping for guidance, hoping for answers. Maybe you, dear Reddit, hold the key to my heart.\n\nWhat is the best solution for someone like me?\n\nIs there a way to break through the barriers of prejudice and find true connection?\n\nHow do I navigate this world, where love seems so elusive, and every step forward feels like a step back?\n\nPlease, share your thoughts, your experiences, your advice. Let\u2019s find a way together.\n\nWith hope and desperation,\n\n[Your Name]"

But how could such a silly smiley sing-song, a story, ever come from a 29-year-tiny-twinkling-there-nowhere-never-will-no-not-ever, this tiny twinkle, twinkling there no more. *tear tear* \n\nAnd here, I was just beginning. The PhD, a peek into the future and something oh-so-serious \u2013 but not as serious, as sacred, as soaring... as seeing a star set somewhere. A star, a supernova, shining, smiling\u2026 smiling at me and me alone, and now, just when I thought I could catch that cloud for a chase? That cloud has vanished, vanishing, VANSISHING! Vanished, the vanishing star. And the sky was just so blue. So blank. Blank.\n\nOh, what\u2019s the big blue ball of blue but a bolder, bolder, bolder, BOLD new beginning. Because I\u2019ve seen so many skies, seen, seen so many stars shimmer, shimmer, SHimmer\u2026 shimmer\u2026 shimmering, shining, SHeRInG, SheRiNg, Sherrrrring, SheRinG, SHeRRrinG\u2026 SHEERRSinG\u2026 shimmered. Sheer shirrin\u2019 shrin\u2014shrined! Shrinned in her spirit so pure, shrilled in my soul so true, shivered in the silence of a shadow on her side, and shattered in a space\u2026 space so vast we vaster were vaster, vaTser.

Two years ago, I found myself entangled in a relationship that felt like the dawn after a long, dark night. She was the light that pierced through the fog, the warmth that made the cold world feel less cold. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ended. The pain is a vivid tapestry of emotions, each thread a memory, each stitch a reminder of what once was.\n\nAm I too old for love now? Is it too late to find that person who will make me feel alive again, who will make me want to wake up every morning with a smile on my face? The thought terrifies me, yet I hold onto it with the desperation of a drowning man clutching at straws. How could I possibly believe that there's still a chance for something beautiful, something real?\n\nI am a person woven from complex threads, a quilt of quirks and contradictions. Not everyone can get along with me, and I can't see myself in a relationship with many people. But she... she was the only one. She was the one who saw beyond my flaws, who loved me for who I am. She was the one I wanted to be forever with, the one I dreamed of waking up beside every day. How can I believe that such a person exists, that she isn't just a figment of my imagination, a dream that slipped away like sand through my fingers?\n\nReddit, please prove me wrong. Show me that there's still a chance for something wonderful, something that will make my heart sing again. Is it too late? Can love truly bloom again, or am I destined to spend the rest of my days alone, longing for what once was?\n\nThe world is vast and full of possibilities, but sometimes it feels like a lonely place. Am I really too old for love? Or is it simply that I haven't found the right person yet? Please, Reddit, help me find the answer. Help me believe that there's still a chance for something beautiful."

I can\u2019t help but think that something beautiful is blossoming, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to hear your heart\u2019s answer.\n\nThese past days between us have brought a fire of fascination, fun, fluttering fingers (and a few flying faces), and\u2014oh, the funny flicker just now... that feeling that tells you it\u2019s real. And then\u2026 well, you know just what it was (a little kiss on the cheek, or the corner of your cheek, no less, my sweet friend). A kiss that told a million words in a single touch.\n\nNow, I know we\u2019re still scattered by state lines, spinning wheels of dreams and dust on each wheel\u2026 but isn\u2019t every romance the riddle of its own rhyme, whispered over miles, under starlit skies\u2026 sown softly into sombre summer nights? \n\nMy darling, we could weave a web so wide, one we whisper into each winter\u2019s wake! Yet how we twirl and trilled to turn this tangle to tapestry? \n\nI believe it\u2019s time to tie these threads together\u2014twist by twist.

The memories of our childhood friendship, the vivid imagery of those carefree days spent together, the way her laughter still echoes in my mind, and the tender moments we shared\u2014these thoughts flood my consciousness, making it difficult to form coherent sentences. Yet, here I am, compelled to share this journey with someone who might understand, someone who might offer guidance.\n\nHow does one navigate such uncharted territory, especially when the very idea of pursuing a relationship seems so surreal? I find myself lost in a labyrinth of feelings, each turn revealing more questions than answers. How do I approach her, knowing full well that we are separated by miles and the challenges of a long-distance relationship in college? What if she feels differently? What if she is hesitant, unsure, or simply not interested in a relationship that would require so much sacrifice?\n\nI remember the day we met up again, the warmth of the sun on our faces, the gentle breeze carrying the scent of blooming flowers, and the way her smile lit up the world around us. Those moments felt like a dream, a beautiful fantasy that I never wanted to wake from. And yet, here we are, planning our next encounter, our hearts beating in sync despite the distance between us. Is this enough? Can a connection formed over messages and video calls sustain a relationship?\n\nI know that many have succeeded in long-distance relationships, but is it possible for us? How do we bridge the gap, not just physically but emotionally and mentally? What if she decides that the distance is too much to bear, that she needs someone closer by? These fears gnaw at me, creating a constant sense of unease, a lingering doubt that threatens to overshadow the joy we find in each other's company.\n\nI want to be brave, to take a chance, to show her that I am willing to face whatever comes our way. But how do I do that? Should I be more direct, more assertive? Or should I continue to let our relationship evolve naturally, hoping that it will flourish without my pushing too hard? The future is uncertain, filled with endless possibilities, and I am torn between embracing the unknown and clinging to the familiar.\n\nSo, dear friend, if you read this, please, offer me your wisdom. Guide me through this journey, help me find the courage to pursue what I believe is right. For in this moment, I am lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty, and all I can do is hope that your advice will be the lighthouse that guides me back to shore.\n\nThank you for any feedback you might offer. I hold my breath, waiting for your response, knowing that whatever you say will shape the course of my life.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

Can it be that fate itself had orchestrated this turn of events, or is it simply the whimsical dance of chance and coincidence? As I sit here, surrounded by the remnants of their old world, the television sits before me like a silent sentinel, its screen a canvas waiting to be painted with images of the past and the present.\n\nHow could I not feel an overwhelming sense of nostalgia when I think about the countless hours spent watching reruns of our favorite shows, the laughter and tears that filled our living room? The way the light danced across the screen, casting shadows that seemed to whisper secrets of the stories within, the sound of the TV humming softly in the background as we shared meals and conversations\u2014these memories are as vivid as the colors on the screen itself.\n\nAnd so, with a heart brimming with both joy and sorrow, I find myself standing at the crossroads of memory and new beginnings. The purchase of a new stand, a sleek and modern piece that contrasts starkly with the aged beauty of the LG2000, marks not just a transition but a bittersweet farewell to a chapter of life. How do I reconcile the excitement of exploring new worlds through this device with the melancholy of letting go of the old?\n\nThe stream of consciousness swirls around me, a torrent of thoughts and emotions that threaten to overwhelm. What stories will unfold on this screen? Will the faces that greet me each morning be those of my dear parents, or will they be strangers whose lives I will come to know and love? The possibilities are endless, yet the void left by their absence looms large.\n\nAs I gaze at the LG2000, I am reminded of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. This TV, a tangible link to the past, now serves as a bridge to the future, carrying with it the weight of memories and the promise of new experiences. How can I possibly convey the depth of my gratitude for this unexpected inheritance, this portal to a world of endless possibilities?\n\nIn the end, it is not just about the TV or the new stand; it is about the journey of life, filled with moments of joy and sorrow, laughter and tears. As I prepare to plug in this device that will undoubtedly bring many more memories, I wonder if the universe has truly conspired to grant me this gift, or if it is merely a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of existence.\n\nMay this LG2000 continue to light up my world with the warmth of memories and the promise of new adventures.\n</email>"

Is it too much to ask for him to understand that I am simply trying to be considerate, to respect his boundaries, to support him when he needs it most? Yet, it feels as though I am constantly walking on eggshells, never quite sure if I am stepping into a world of sunshine or darkness. Today, I attempted to reach out, to connect, to bridge the gap between us. I shared a funny letter that resonated with him, hoping to bring a smile to his face. Instead, I received a scathing response, one that cut deeper than any blade could ever do.\n\nIs it too much to ask for a simple conversation, a moment of understanding? When I suggested he come over, even knowing he was exhausted, I was merely trying to show that I cared, that I wanted to be there for him. But according to him, I had told him not to come. According to me, I was being considerate. How can we possibly communicate when our interpretations are so vastly different?\n\nThe pain is unbearable. Each passing minute feels like an eternity, each moment of silence a knife twisting in my heart. I have reached out to him, pleaded with him to work through this with me, to find a way forward.

Do I not deserve a chance to prove myself, to show him that I am worth fighting for?\n\nHow can I continue to hold onto this love when it feels as though it is slipping through my fingers like sand? I want to be strong, to fight for him, but how can I when I am beginning to lose myself in the process? Am I alone in this struggle, or is there someone out there who can offer me some semblance of hope?\n\nPlease, dear friends, help me navigate this tumultuous journey. Guide me through the labyrinth of my own emotions, help me find a way to communicate, to understand, and to heal. I do not want to lose him, but I also cannot bear the thought of losing myself in the process.\n\nThank you for listening to my plea. May your guidance and support light my way."

    "PROSE": "<email>\nIn the quiet solitude of my thoughts, the narrative weaves through the labyrinth of my mind, each twist and turn a testament to the tempest within. How could it be that a mere seven-minute delay in a phone call could conjure such a vivid tableau of catastrophe? The image of him, perhaps lying in a hospital bed, blood pooling beneath him, bleeds into my consciousness with such intensity that I can almost feel the chill of the sterile environment and hear the distant hum of medical equipment. But how is it possible that such a scenario could arise from a simple act of forgetfulness?\n\nAnd yet, here we are, ensnared in the web of my own anxieties. Is it not ironic that the very act of worrying about his wellbeing, a concern born out of genuine care, should lead me down a path of such dark imaginings? Could it be that the human heart, with its capacity for love, is also burdened by the weight of its own vulnerabilities? Is it not true that every moment of uncertainty is a potential gateway to fear, and every act of kindness a seed for worry?\n\nWhat if, in my relentless pursuit of reassurance, I am merely amplifying the very fears I seek to alleviate? How many times must I ask myself, \"What if something truly terrible has happened?\" Only to find, as the phone finally rings, that the reality is far less dramatic and far more mundane. The dog, with its untimely accident, serves as a stark reminder of the everyday challenges that life presents.\n\nAnd so, I wonder, in this endless cycle of doubt and relief, is there any escape from the tyranny of my own mind? Can I ever truly let go of the grip that anxiety has on me, or will it continue to weave its intricate patterns, each one more vivid than the last? Is it possible to find peace in the midst of chaos, to embrace the present without being consumed by the specter of the future?\n\nAs I sit here, the tension between hope and fear tugs at my soul, each emotion a thread in the tapestry of my existence. How can I navigate this treacherous landscape, where every step forward is met with a shadow of doubt? Will I ever learn to trust in the resilience of those around me, or will I remain forever trapped in the cycle of worry and reassurance?\n\nPhew \u2013 another round of anxiety averted, but at what cost? The weight of my own thoughts bears down upon me, a silent burden that I carry with me always. Can I ever find the strength to break free from this cycle, or will I continue to dance on the edge of despair, waiting for the next call, the next potential crisis?\n\nIn the stillness of this moment, I am left with only my thoughts, a tumultuous sea of emotions and fears. How will I find the path to calm, to peace, amidst the storm within?"

My name is [Your Name], and I purchased an Xbox from Futureshop (now Best Buy Canada) just under a year ago, on [Exact Date], and I'm reaching out today with a most peculiar predicament. For the fourth time now, my Xbox\u2014once more adorned with its gleaming glory!\u2014has decided to quit its duty in my hand, and once again, it's not even seen six short sleeps of slumber since we've swapped sides for one.\n\nFor those of you Americans across the ocean, Futureshop\u2014formerly your friend\u2014now stands at the crossroad of your Canadian cousins, Best Buy with our brand\u2019s nectar of the north, now known as Best Buy Canada Ltd. But no matter the banner of its flag, I can only cry... what's the word? Weep\u2026 at your will's unyielding\u2026 why's it so much?\n\nA wondrous web of wonder wove in weeks; it started the day I dared daunt down your dark domain and dived into deep despair, the depths of darkness, darker still than the deepest night. A year and but a month had marked my mortal mark upon your map, when, oh, Ode to One, a voice did vibrate, a voice so vibrant, the very vein of victory! \"The X-box of X-acton, the one you, Yea, yes, YOU, YES!

Verly VERLY ver-verververververververv... V V V V VV VVV! And yet! Yes, yet yet yes! Yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yes!

    "PROSE": "<email>\nOh, how can one not feel a surge of frustration and despair when their beloved Xbox, the gateway to countless hours of gaming and entertainment, crumbles before their very eyes? The fourth time it's failed, breaking my heart with each click of the power button, leaving me staring at a blank screen where vibrant worlds once thrived. Is this really how my gaming journey should end? How could a device that promised so much deliver such disappointment?\n\nFutureshop, the largest electronics store in Canada, had given me a three-year warranty, a beacon of hope in the dark abyss of potential failures. Yet, after over a year of faithful service, my Xbox succumbed to the dreaded E74 hardware error. With a sinking feeling in my stomach, I brought it in, hoping for a quick fix. A week later, I received a call from Futureshop, and there I stood, clutching my repaired console, marveling at its restored glory. But alas, the joy was fleeting, for just a few months later, the E74 error reared its ugly head again, and the cycle began anew.\n\nI took it back, and then, a few weeks later, it was back in my hands, seemingly unscathed. But the cruel twist of fate struck once more. Just a few weeks after that, the same error appeared, leaving me bewildered and questioning the very essence of trust and reliability. How could a company, or rather, a brand that once stood tall, now crumble under the weight of its own promises?\n\nAnd so, I waited, months passed, and still, the Xbox remained silent. Was it a test of patience, or a silent plea for attention? Why must I suffer through this endless cycle of repairs, each one more frustrating than the last? Could it be that the E74 error is some kind of digital boogeyman, haunting my every move, or is it simply a flaw in the system that even the best technicians cannot overcome?\n\nThe story of my Xbox is not just one of personal frustration but a larger tale of consumer disillusionment. In a world where technology is supposed to make our lives easier and more enjoyable, why do we find ourselves constantly battling against it? Is it too much to ask for a device to simply work without constant intervention? As I sit here, typing this message, I wonder if others have faced similar struggles, or if I am alone in my plight.\n\nFor all you American Redditors, Futureshop, now known as Best Buy Canada Ltd., is the embodiment of this struggle. Their name change, while a mere title, carries with it the weight of a promise broken. Check out the Wikipedia page for more information, but more importantly, consider the stories behind those pages, the tales of countless consumers like myself who have been let down.\n\nIs there any solution to this endless cycle? Can we trust in the brands and stores that once seemed so reliable, or must we continue to navigate this treacherous landscape of technological unpredictability? The questions swirl in my mind like a storm, each one more intense than the last, as I ponder the future of my beloved gaming console and the trust that once bound us together.\n</email>"

Here\u2019s how it happened. As you knew, my knees were giving me some grief today. And while I felt crushed not reaching 16 miles\u2014just because my mind had mapped out an entire new world to waltz in\u2014my friends thought you should celebrate with me!\n\nI\u2019d love to let you live the life of a legend in that mile-long league, until the next time, when your cookie cookie comment came crashing in. Now, a cheddar cake cookie for my 12-miler seems more like 9,009,009,009 to someone who knows where I keep every line in this lonesome list of lists.\n\nSo now here we are, a little tattered, but still standing, trying to stitch this stitch of us\u2026 together. In truth, your words cut through my chest with that cookie-cutting cookie. Your jokes on our joint-jumping journey are as joyous as the sunrise in my soul. And you never meant a single scratch to scorch, you\u2019re just a good friend, right?\n\nYet, the words\u2026 those words\u2026 well, I fear they fell through the same fathomless fissure where once I tried to tiptoe. And there\u2019s that, a thing we must talk, in your way\u2014witty and wise, with wildflowers wilful and wistful with wisdom. How do we make a mountain more molehill and a mite a might?

I\u2019ll try to try, and truly try, till tomorrow, to tilt the tilt of this tiltiling tide tide-tight tightest of truths, truer to thee, teetop-toe, titillating to tottles!

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how tangled up in knots my heart lies tonight, as I sit here penning these words to you. I\u2019ve had an eating disorder for over a decade now \u2013 not that it matters, but it\u2019s anorexia. I don\u2019t mean to sound flippant; I\u2019m not scary thin, and on the outside, I think I look very \u201cnormal\u201d and like I have an athletic body. Yet, inside, I\u2019m battling demons that whisper and gnaw at my resolve. I\u2019m recovering from a very recent relapse, and I\u2019m doing okay, but the shadows of my past still linger, ready to pounce at any moment.\n\nToday, I had a long run on the schedule, and due to my knee problems, I only managed to run 12 miles instead of the 16 I\u2019d planned. I was crushed. My muscles ached, my lungs burned, and my mind screamed at me, \"Why aren\u2019t you strong enough? Why can\u2019t you push through?\" I hung out with friends, including Matt, and told them all this. They all told me I was crazy, that 12 miles is more than enough to celebrate. But the words echoed in my head, taunting me, mocking my progress.\n\nShortly after, I was starving and had the biggest cookie in front of me. My stomach growled, and I felt the familiar hunger coursing through my veins. I thought about the mileage, and how I hadn\u2019t hit my goal, and I found myself wanting to spit the cookie out of my mouth. Matt, ever the comedian, said, \"But you didn\u2019t run 16! You only ran 12 so you shouldn\u2019t be having the cookie!\" I found it so triggering. We joke around a lot about tons of topics, including food, but sometimes I\u2019ll find his joking remarks triggering, even when he\u2019s saying something as simple as \"How did you eat that much at breakfast?! You are a beast!\"\n\nA large part of me feels like this is my problem. It\u2019s my disorder, and there will always be people making triggering comments. Matt and I are friends, we text and go out for food or drinks, but we\u2019re not super emotionally close. I tell almost no one about my disorder and I would be embarrassed to tell him. To be clear, I am in no way angry at Matt for these comments: he does not know about my disorder. He is also a really nice guy and means absolutely no harm. But does anyone have any advice, either in terms of what I should do with regards to Matt and/or how I can internally deal with triggering comments?\n\nThe world seems so vast and indifferent, yet every word, every action, every comment can feel like a knife twisting in my heart. How do I navigate these waters without sinking? How do I protect myself from the waves that crash against my fragile walls? I want to trust, to open up, to share my struggles, but fear holds me back. Am I alone in this? Do others feel this way too?\n\nPlease, if you have any advice, any words of wisdom, any glimmer of hope, I would be forever grateful. For now, I\u2019ll keep swimming, keep fighting, and keep holding onto the belief that tomorrow might just be better."

    "PROSE": "<email>\nMy dearest [Partner's Name],\n\nOh, how I struggle with the weight of this question, my heart heavy with the intensity of our love and the uncertainty that shrouds our future. You are the most incredible person I know, a gem that shines brighter than the sun, more beautiful and intelligent than you can ever imagine. Our moments together, cuddled up on the couch, or lost in the pages of a book, are nothing short of magical. Every laugh, every smile, every touch, they paint a vivid picture of a life that feels almost too perfect to be true.\n\nYet, there lies a bittersweet truth. You haven't been 'single' in the past five years, a span filled with fleeting relationships and the promise of more to come. The thought of you enjoying your senior year, free from the constraints of a relationship, fills me with both joy and anxiety. Is it selfish of me to want to be by your side through every moment, or am I being naive in thinking that distance won't matter?\n\nHow can I possibly understand your desire to take this break, to savor the last year of your academic journey without the burden of a boyfriend? I live 2.5 hours away, a distance that may seem insignificant, but in the realm of our love, it feels like an ocean apart. Visiting every weekend during the summer and the entire school year was the plan, a promise that we would stay close, but now, as I grapple with the reality of this situation, I wonder if such plans are realistic.\n\nDo breaks work in long-distance relationships? Can love survive the test of time when separated by miles and schedules? My mind races with these questions, each one more daunting than the last. Should I trust in our love, believing that it can withstand the trials of distance? Or should I be prepared for the possibility that it might not be enough, that the void between us will be too great to bridge?\n\nEvery part of me yearns to hold onto the hope that we can make this work, that our love is strong enough to transcend the physical distance. But, oh, how I fear the alternative, the thought of losing you to the comfort of campus life, to the familiarity of friends and routines. I pour my heart into every word, hoping to convey the depth of my emotions, the intensity of my feelings, and the uncertainty that clouds my mind.\n\nWhat path should we choose? How do we navigate this uncharted territory, where the lines between love and reality blur? Your senior year is just around the corner, and I find myself torn between my desire to support you and my fear of being left behind. In the end, I must ask: can we truly find a way to make this work, or is it better to let this break be a chance for us to grow apart, to see if our love can thrive in the absence of each other?\n\nI wait for your response with bated breath, hoping that together, we can find the answer that will guide us forward.\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

Just for a moment, my dear, a flicker of a whisper, a mere wishful wish... What would you think if we tried talking things out, seeing if there\u2019s a way to keep the castle of gold where my feet are firmly stamped with love \u2013 oh! Our own [current company name] \u2013 a treasure trove of trust that\u2019s tendered every tinge, tone, and thump of my toil in thy halls?\n\nJust in the dimly distant distance, a ray of sunken shadow shimmers\u2026 But, I\u2019m ever hopeful, hallowed heart, the horizon holds a hope, not a heartache, just a whisper of wind, warm and wanting, wishing, willing, will we, won\u2019t we?\n\nThank you for understanding, just so we know that, if there\u2019s a trinity of truth, truth that\u2019s truest... Truth so, so true, in thee, thy toil, thy throne of tomorrows, tomorrow\u2019s tale-tale... It\u2019s thy truth, thou truth so true, \u2018tis thou, thy truth to tell, \u2018til we till our truth...\n\nAnd then... just... just just... the jolt of joy, the jubilant jingle of just... JUST!

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how tangled the web of emotions has become! I find myself at a crossroads, with one path leading to a familiar comfort and the other to an unknown adventure. The situation is that I am currently employed, and though the job itself is a joy, the financial aspect leaves much to be desired. The thought of leaving my current workplace, where the camaraderie is as thick as the coffee we share, is akin to parting ways with a dear friend. Yet, the horizon beckons with the promise of a new opportunity, one that calls twice over the phone and is now setting a date for an in-person interview. How can I navigate this delicate dance without burning any bridges, both from my current employer and the potential new one? \n\nThe vivid imagery of my current office comes alive before my eyes\u2014the laughter during team meetings, the quiet moments of focus, the shared victories and challenges. Each memory is as bright and clear as the sun on a crisp morning. But the allure of the new opportunity is undeniable, a siren\u2019s call promising growth and challenge. The commute to the new employer's location, about 40 miles away, seems daunting, like a long journey through a dense forest, where the path is uncertain and the destination unknown.\n\nHow can I accept the new offer with the hope that my current employer might match it, allowing me to stay and continue the journey we\u2019ve embarked upon together? The idea of staying with my current employer, despite the financial shortfall, is like holding onto a precious piece of jewelry, knowing its value but also its limitations. Yet, the thought of making the 40-mile commute daily feels like a heavy burden, a weight that could crush the spirit and the will to thrive.\n\nWhat if I were to draft a response that acknowledges the new opportunity, expressing gratitude for their interest and the potential for growth, while subtly hinting at the possibility of a counteroffer? Could I write something along the lines of, \"Thank you for the incredible opportunity to join your esteemed organization. I am truly honored by your interest and the trust you have placed in me. However, I am deeply committed to my current role and the team I work with. If there is any way to bridge the gap between our current compensation and the offer you have extended, I would be more than willing to consider staying with the current employer.\" Would such a response convey the depth of my feelings while leaving the door open for negotiation?\n\nEach word I type feels like a brushstroke on a canvas, painting a picture of my inner turmoil. How can I ensure that my current employer understands the value I bring to the table, the unique contributions I make, and the potential for continued growth and success? The stream of consciousness flows through my mind, weaving together thoughts and emotions into a tapestry of possibilities. What if, in my next meeting with my current employer, I were to present a case for why a small increase in salary or benefits could be beneficial for both parties? Could this approach foster a dialogue that leads to a mutually beneficial solution?\n\nAs I ponder these questions, the world around me seems to pause, allowing me to reflect on the choices before me. The journey ahead is fraught with uncertainty, yet filled with the hope of new beginnings. How can I navigate this path with grace and integrity, ensuring that no matter which direction I choose, I leave behind a legacy of loyalty and commitment?\n\nIn the end, the decision will be mine to make, but the journey to reach that decision is one that requires careful consideration and a heart full of emotion. May the path chosen be the one that brings the greatest happiness and fulfillment."

I am writing in regard to our conversation just moments before you hung up the phone last week. Just to make sure there was no momentary misunderstanding, everything went beautifully, and we were both brimming with possibilities for how we could grow and flourish together.\n\nJust now, you mentioned that you couldn\u2019t quite crack through the shell of one of my old oaks of... oh, okay, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m talking of a few oakish trunks standing tall in this vast woodwork! \ud83d\ude04 They\u2019re the stalwart, silent sentinels of my soul, the ones who know me better than anyone else, and your query of theirs has struck a bit of a string in a song so solemn, so solemn it seemed you\u2019d pluck the very soul out of the silence, just like the whisper in the wind\u2014\n\nBut I jest, I jest!

Just a month ago, I stepped out of the internship phase, feeling like a bird about to spread its wings, only to take a couple of weeks to rest and recharge. The world seemed to slow down, allowing me to breathe deeply and prepare for the next chapter. And then, the job hunt began\u2014a relentless, pulsating heartbeat that thunders through every moment.\n\nLast week, I found myself standing before four different interviewers, their eyes reflecting the same mixture of curiosity and potential. Each conversation felt like a symphony of possibilities, each one more captivating than the last. And then, within a blink of an eye, came the news that resonated through my soul\u2014contact from each company, but not the ones I needed most. They couldn\u2019t reach two of my references, leaving me in a whirlwind of uncertainty and concern.\n\nI have reached out to those references, my voice trembling with a mix of hope and despair, but alas, no response. It\u2019s as if the very air around me is thick with frustration and helplessness. I\u2019ve never faced this challenge before, nor have I felt so vulnerable. What should I do? Should I reach out to the hiring managers and offer alternative references? Am I being too bold, or perhaps not bold enough?\n\nIsn\u2019t it ironic how the very process designed to showcase our strengths can sometimes expose our weaknesses? I find myself torn between the need for professionalism and the desire to ensure that my efforts are not in vain. Should I take the leap and offer these alternatives, knowing full well it might be seen as unprofessional? Or should I wait, hoping that fate will smile upon me and grant me the clarity I seek?\n\nThe journey ahead is fraught with unknowns, yet I am determined to navigate through it with grace and resilience. Each step forward is a testament to my perseverance, and I hold onto that belief with unwavering conviction. What do you think? Should I forge ahead and offer those alternative references, or should I wait for the universe to align itself in my favor?\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s not just about securing a job; it\u2019s about proving that I am capable, resilient, and unwavering in the face of adversity. The path may be winding, but I am ready to walk it with courage and determination.\n\nWith heartfelt hopes and dreams,\n\n[Your Name]"

Is it not true that we are both deeply emotional beings, our hearts as delicate as the petals of a fragile rose, easily bruised by the winds of argument and disagreement?\n\nDo we not, in our moments of clarity, marvel at the resilience of other couples, their bickering and yelling seeming almost comical compared to the depths of despair we experience? Yet, how is it that we, who should be able to weather any storm, find ourselves teetering on the brink of a chasm of discontent? Her rages, unpredictable and fierce, leave me bewildered, as if we are two ships passing in the night, each lost in its own tumultuous sea.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of our arguments have escalated, a crescendo of discord that threatens to drown out the tender whispers of our past. I have always endeavored to maintain a semblance of calm, a lighthouse in the midst of a tempest, yet even I am beginning to crumble under the weight of it all. Have we truly left it too late, or is there still a glimmer of hope, a chance to turn the tide before the ship of our marriage capsizes?\n\nOur home-life is a canvas painted with the hues of stress and responsibility, two school-age children, one with mild special needs and another with severe, creating a tapestry of challenges that binds us irrevocably together.

Yet, the financial constraints are as formidable as a towering mountain, insurmountable and impenetrable. Even if I were to secure a single bedroom in a shared household, the reality of our situation remains unchanged. She, a stay-at-home mother, is now considering returning to the workforce, adding another layer of complexity to our already strained relationship.\n\nI yearn to reverse the trend, to restore the harmony and balance that once defined our union.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how can I possibly begin to express the depths of my despair and the overwhelming emotions that swirl within me? As I sit here, staring at the words I\u2019ve written, I feel as though I am drowning in a sea of shame and self-doubt. The mirror reflects back a version of myself that feels alien, a stranger whose face I recognize but cannot accept. My body, once a source of strength and pride, now hangs before me like a ragged, tattered flag, a symbol of my failure and inadequacy.\n\nHow many times have I stood in front of that mirror, my reflection staring back at me with a cruel, unyielding gaze? Love handles, folds, and a sagging body\u2014these are the things I see, not the muscles and strength that once defined me. And when I step into the gym, change in front of my wife or a physician, the anxiety and mortification are almost unbearable. What if they see me, truly see me, and judge me for what I am? How do I hide this version of myself from those who love me most?\n\nThe numbers on the scale taunt me, a constant reminder of my perceived shortcomings. Despite the countless attempts and the well-meaning advice, I find myself slipping back into old patterns, eating more when the scale shows any increase. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m trapped in a never-ending cycle of self-destruction, unable to break free from the chains of my own fears and insecurities.\n\nWhat is it about my body that makes me so ashamed? Is it really just a matter of calories in versus calories out, or is there something deeper at play? How much longer must I suffer in silence, hiding behind excuses and rationalizations? Am I truly incapable of change, or is it simply a matter of finding the right path forward?\n\nMy vitals, my BMR, my daily intake\u2014these statistics are a mere shadow of the turmoil within. I consume a balanced diet rich in proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, all carefully chosen to fuel my body and support my health. Yet, despite my efforts, the results elude me. Is it possible that I am not eating enough, as my wife suggests? Or perhaps I am not burning enough through exercise? The questions swirl around me, a maelstrom of doubt and uncertainty.\n\nI have committed to lifting again, to pushing myself beyond the limits of my current capabilities. But what if I fail? What if I hurt myself again, leaving me even more vulnerable and fragile? The fear is paralyzing, a constant companion that whispers doubts and insecurities into my ear. And yet, I know that I must try, that I owe it to myself and those who care for me to fight this battle, no matter how daunting it may seem.\n\nAs I write this, I wonder if there will ever be a moment of clarity, a breakthrough that will allow me to see myself clearly, without the distortions of shame and self-doubt. Will I ever feel confident in my own skin, able to stand tall and proud, regardless of the numbers on the scale? These are the questions that haunt me, the ones that keep me awake at night, replaying in my mind like a broken record.\n\nAnd so, I continue on this journey, one step at a time, hoping against hope that I might find the strength and courage to overcome the obstacles that stand between me and my true self. If there is any chance, no matter how small, that I can break free from this cycle of despair, I will take it. For I am more than the sum of my struggles, more than the weight on a scale or the folds in my skin. I am a person, with dreams and hopes and the capacity for growth and change.\n\nEven if I am dead, even if my body no longer exists, my spirit remains, yearning for redemption and understanding. May this email serve as a testament to my resilience and determination, a call to action for anyone who may be struggling with similar battles. Let us find the strength within ourselves to face our fears, to embrace our imperfections, and to strive for a better tomorrow.\n\nWith all my heart,\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear Community,\n\nI find myself at a loss for words as I pen this message, a testament to the intense emotions swirling within me. The scene that unfolded today in our building's laundry room was nothing short of surreal, a vivid tableau that I can hardly believe played out before my very eyes. Our building, a modest 3-story structure with its own rhythm and pace, houses two washers and two dryers per floor, a layout designed to accommodate the bustling lives of its residents. Sunday, of course, is the grand crescendo of laundry days, a time when everyone seems to converge, each person eager to reclaim their clean, fresh garments.\n\nI had placed my clothes in the washer, a simple task that should have been routine. Twenty-five minutes later, I checked on them, finding the dryer in use. As the minutes ticked by, I found myself checking periodically, a stream of consciousness that mirrored the anxiety building within me. Forty-five minutes into the drying cycle, I approached the dryer, only to discover that the occupants had long since completed their cycle but had left their clothes untouched, still in the machine. I waited, hoping for some sign of action, but the dryer remained cold, the clothes inside equally lifeless. Who the hell does that?\n\nForty-five minutes later, I returned to check once more, my patience wearing thin. Still, no one emerged from their apartment. Another twenty-five minutes passed, and I found myself at the edge of despair, my clothes still damp and unwashed. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the person reappeared, their actions as abrupt as they were dismissive. They pulled their clothes from the dryer, leaving it wide open, as if to say, \"Here, you can use this now.\" Who the hell does that?\n\nWe only have two washers and two dryers per floor, resources that must be shared with care and respect. Yet, here we are, in a situation where someone\u2019s disregard for the communal nature of our space is so profound that they leave their clothes in the dryer for an hour, on the busiest laundry day of the week. And then, they act as if they\u2019re doing me a favor by allowing me to use the dryer. Who the hell does that?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about the inconvenience of waiting; it\u2019s about the fundamental respect we owe each other in our shared living space. It\u2019s about recognizing that our actions have consequences, especially when we share limited resources. I understand that everyone has their own routines and schedules, but surely there\u2019s a way to navigate these challenges with more consideration and less selfishness.\n\nIf we continue to allow such behavior, we risk undermining the very community we strive to build. We need to find a way to communicate, to support each other, and to ensure that our shared spaces remain functional and fair. Who the hell does that?\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

The touch of a familiar hand, the warmth of a comforting smile\u2014these were the balm to my wounds. Yet, like a storm that follows a calm, the tempest of my ex's accusations brought me back to the brink. But it was then, in the midst of chaos, that another light flickered\u2014a spark that ignited a new flame. We danced through the night, our feet barely touching the ground as if suspended in a dream. And in that moment, a truth was revealed\u2014a truth that neither of us could deny.\n\nBut alas, the echoes of the past still linger, haunting our present. In the dead of night, when the world was silent and my thoughts flowed like a river, I blurted out words that were not meant to be heard. In that instant, I lost not only her trust but also a piece of myself. The weight of her silence now presses upon my soul, a heavy burden that I must bear until I earn her trust once more.\n\nHow do I mend a broken trust? How do I bridge the chasm that yawns between us? Trust is like a delicate flower, easily withered by the harsh winds of doubt. It requires patience, care, and a steadfast commitment to prove one's worth. But how does one prove themselves when the very fabric of their being seems tainted by the past?\n\nShould I pour out my heart in letters, hoping to convey the depth of my feelings? Or perhaps a heartfelt conversation, where the words flow like a stream, cleansing the air between us? Maybe a simple act of kindness, something small yet meaningful, will show her that I am worthy of her trust.\n\nEach day, I walk a tightrope, balancing on the edge of hope and despair.

Will it be filled with vibrant colors or left blank, a testament to the fear that grips my heart?\n\nAs we prepare to walk down the aisle of prom, side by side, I cannot help but wonder if this is merely a dance of pretense or a step towards something deeper. Promises are fragile things, like the petals of a rose, and they require constant nurturing to bloom.\n\nSo, dear friend, what shall I do? How can I regain the trust that I have lost? Perhaps the answer lies in the simplest of actions, the most genuine of gestures. Only time will tell, but I am determined to find a way, no matter how long it takes.\n\nUntil Monday, may the stars guide us and the moon shine bright upon our journey.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name]"

I find myself lost in a labyrinth of emotions, where every step feels as heavy as the weight of my own heart. How can I possibly untangle this mess, especially when it comes to matters of the heart? Am I simply yearning for a change, or is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for over two years now, a period that feels like an eternity in some moments and not enough time in others. We\u2019re both college students, navigating the tumultuous waters of academia and love, yet our relationship remains a harmonious symphony, save for the occasional discordant note. These arguments, though frequent, are nothing more than minor skirmishes, battles fought over petty things that seem so trivial in the grand scheme of our lives together.\n\nBut then there\u2019s this girl, a vision of beauty that catches my eye in one of my classes. Her presence is like a soft, lingering mist that permeates my thoughts, making it difficult to focus on anything else. She\u2019s not just physically attractive; there\u2019s something about her that draws me in, a magnetic pull that I can\u2019t ignore. I catch her staring at me frequently, and the thought of her gaze upon me is both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\nWhen I finally mustered the courage to approach her, I felt a rush of adrenaline, like a sprinter on the cusp of a race. Our conversation was a dance, a delicate balance of giving and receiving, each word carefully chosen to keep the rhythm of our exchange alive. When I decided to test the waters by ceasing my questions, hoping to see if she would follow, her response was unexpected. She didn\u2019t retreat; instead, she took the lead, asking questions that kept the conversation flowing like a gentle stream. I could feel her nervousness, the way her words stumbled over themselves, but there was also a spark of interest, a glimmer of curiosity that made my heart race.\n\nNow, I\u2019m consumed by these thoughts, unable to shake the image of her from my mind. Is this just a fleeting fancy, a high school crush rearing its head once again? Or am I truly feeling something deeper, something that could potentially disrupt the peace I\u2019ve found with my girlfriend? The idea of throwing everything away to pursue a girl who might not even be interested in me is both thrilling and terrifying.\n\nDo I need a change, a fresh start, or am I simply chasing shadows? Can I trust my own heart, or is it leading me down a path I might regret? As I sit here, lost in thought, I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is just another phase, another chapter in a story that will eventually fade into memory. But for now, I\u2019m left with these intense feelings, vivid images, and a torrent of questions that threaten to overwhelm me.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I reach out to her, or should I let this all fade away like a dream? The answers elude me, leaving me to wander through this emotional maze, searching for clarity in the midst of chaos."

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how tangled and messy these feelings are, like a knot of yarn that refuses to untangle itself, no matter how many times you try to unravel it. Just three months into this journey, and already, the world feels like it\u2019s spinning out of control. I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for such a short time, yet every moment with her feels like a treasure, each touch, each smile, each whispered word, a precious gem that I can\u2019t help but hold close to my heart.\n\nWe\u2019re both from the same country, but now we find ourselves living in Ireland, a land of green rolling hills and misty mornings. She was planning to return to our home country after graduation, but now, she\u2019s staying to be closer to me. It\u2019s a decision that feels so right, like the stars aligning perfectly in the night sky, yet it leaves me with a gnawing sense of unease. She\u2019s incredibly career-oriented, and the thought of her landing a fantastic job here terrifies me, because it means that if I were to suddenly decide to move to Australia, she might see it as a reckless and impulsive choice, something that could jeopardize her future.\n\nThe idea of moving to Australia for a year of college is something I\u2019ve longed for, a dream that\u2019s been simmering in the back of my mind since I first set foot in this foreign land. But now, the thought of telling her feels like a betrayal, like breaking a promise that I never even made. How do I explain to her that I\u2019m torn between my dreams and my love for her? How do I tell her that even though I want her to move with me, I fear that she might see it as a selfish act, a move that could derail her career plans?\n\nIs it too soon to talk about the future? Is it too soon to admit that I want to be with her, no matter where life takes us? Or is it simply too soon to admit that I don\u2019t want to wait another eight months to be with her, to hold her in my arms, to share my life with her? Every day, I wonder if our relationship is destined to fail, if the distance between us is too vast to bridge, if the gap between our dreams is too wide to fill. Is it really that strange to want to move to Australia with her, after just being together for three months? \n\nBut I can\u2019t help but feel that if the relationship does end someday, I\u2019ll regret not taking that chance, not pursuing that degree, not chasing after the education that could change my life forever. If everything falls apart, at least I\u2019ll have that piece of paper to show for it, a tangible reminder of the path I chose. And yet, the fear of losing her, of pushing her away, of making her feel like she has to choose between her dreams and me, is paralyzing.\n\nHow do I navigate this emotional labyrinth, this complex web of feelings and fears? How do I make sense of it all, of the love that burns so intensely within me, the dreams that call to me like siren songs, and the reality that threatens to tear us apart? I don\u2019t know what to do, or even how to begin to say any of this to her. Maybe it\u2019s best to stay here, to let her pursue her career, to support her from afar, to hope that one day, we can find a way to be together without sacrificing her dreams. But part of me knows that if I stay, I\u2019ll be stuck in a job I hate, a place I don\u2019t belong, a life that feels empty and unfulfilled.\n\nSo, what is the answer? Do I stay here, or do I take the leap? Do I tell her how I feel, or do I keep my thoughts and fears buried deep within me? The weight of these questions is heavy, like a stone in my chest, pressing down on my heart, threatening to suffocate me. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but one thing is certain: my love for her is real, intense, and unyielding, a force that defies logic and reason, a flame that burns bright, even in the darkest of times.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I being too selfish? Is our relationship doomed to fail if I tell her? I don\u2019t know, and I wish I did. I just know that every day, every moment, I\u2019m falling deeper in love with her, and I can\u2019t imagine a life without her by my side. Please, if you read this, let me know what you think. I need guidance, I need direction, I need someone to help me navigate this emotional turmoil.\n\nThank you for understanding, for listening, for being there for me.\n\nWith all my love,\n[Your Name]"

It feels like it was just us, sitting together under those same skies, so full of joyous moments. But now my little universe is shaken, and somehow I\u2019m standing here, utterly stunned.\n\n[His Name], I don\u2019t know where to begin\u2026 This text from [His Name] has hit me like a freight train. I\u2019ve been wanting words to dance into this silence, but none seemed enough, none would do, until I mustered up every courage to type.\n\nI held onto hope, you know\u2014the most fragile, flower-studded one\u2014because I thought every word and whisper, every time our gaze met, meant something. That you loved only me. Now, [His Name], I hold it, shattered to the very soul. For you told [His Name] that there's this tender, tenuous thing between y\u2019all \u2013 a yearning that can't let go, can't leave, can't be put to rest.\n\nAnd what [His hands] said, [His hands] said. Oh, my heart, aching, asking why. Why did you even want to feel [her] skin against yours, again and again, as you were kissing it all over last night?\n\n[His Name], [His name], I need your truth tonight. Tell me it all, every single detail. Show me the sky that sees you so far from here. Don\u2019t you dare say the \u201cwe never made a plan\u2026we didn\u2019t mean a thing\u201d mantra anymore. It\u2019s worn thin on me and not with my old grace. No, [His name], now let me listen, look, see. Let me find all the cracks we\u2019ll break apart from each of you\u2026 and the chasm we\u2019ll stand at. Because I deserve to be the woman who knows you, the man you are today, in all your beautiful truths... and the future you're making, making me wait and wilt for, waiting on your wings to catch me. Isn't [she] worth a second thought?\n\nOh, [His name\u2019s name], I am so lost, and the light you used to shine upon me, [His name]\u2026 it\u2019s flickering in front of me, oh, how cruelly it calls.\n\nWe've only ever known a beginning. Now\u2026 the beast before us, [His face], the fearless beast, what will you choose?\n\nI love you with the whole weight of my tears. Please... please let me see you soon, so maybe, just MAYBE, tomorrow could be a miracle.\n\nIn the end, everything is going to be alright, [His face]. I have faith, yes... but it burns hot within. Can't you feel it?\n\nWith love,  \n[Your name]\n\nP.S. I pray that I find it in you to speak to me, to speak to [She-she's name]. I am a wreck, yet I won, and I won it with a thousand fears but a ten-thousand-thin thread of a whisper from my heart.\n\nTill we talk,  \nTill I touch those trembling thorns\u2026 that tendril of twine that twines, twirls, and turns, turns true \u2013 T'was the night when all of this\u2026 this\u2026 all this began. I'll be back to burn, bright as your beacon of a billion broken stars... and so shall you, shall you?",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, my heart, how could this be? How could my world turn upside down in such a cruel twist of fate? I lay here, staring at the text message, feeling the tears well up as if they were raindrops from a stormy sky. The words, so cold and detached, yet they carry the weight of a thunderclap. \"It wasn't anything big and prolonged,\" he says, as if the mere act of kissing could be minimized, as if the depth of his betrayal could be diluted by the brevity of the encounter. But I know better. I know that a kiss can be a declaration of everything that has been and everything that will never be again. And so, I ask myself, how did we get here?\n\nWas it the distance between us, the miles that seemed to grow wider with each passing day? Was it the longing for his touch, the need to feel the warmth of his embrace? Or was it something deeper, something that had been simmering beneath the surface of our relationship all along, waiting for the right moment to burst forth like a volcano? \n\nI recall the countless nights we spent talking late into the night, our dreams intertwined, our hearts beating as one. We shared everything, from our deepest fears to our wildest hopes. And now, it feels as though a piece of me has been torn away, leaving behind a gaping wound that bleeds into the very core of who I am. \n\nHow could he walk her home, the same way he walks me home, the same way he held me close, the same way he promised to always be there? And then, just like that, the kiss. It's as if the universe itself had conspired against us, forcing us to confront the reality that perhaps, just perhaps, our love was not enough. \n\nBut isn't love supposed to conquer all? Isn't it supposed to transcend distance and time, to overcome even the most insurmountable obstacles? And yet, here we are, standing on the brink of something that could destroy everything we've built together. \n\nWhat does this mean for us? For our future? For the dreams we once shared? How do we move forward when the ground beneath our feet seems to be shifting, when the very foundations of our love are being questioned? \n\nI love you, he writes, over and over again, as if those three little words could somehow erase the pain and the betrayal. But can they? Can words alone heal the wounds that have been inflicted upon my soul? \n\nAnd what about her? Her current relationship, her new life, her choices. How do they fit into this complex tapestry of emotions and desires? Is there any hope left for us, or are we destined to remain forever entangled in a web of regret and sorrow?\n\nI sit here, lost in a sea of conflicting feelings, trying to make sense of this overwhelming flood of emotions. How did we get here? How did we let this happen? And most importantly, how do we find our way back to each other, or is it too late? \n\nThe silence in my apartment feels deafening, as if the world itself has paused to listen to the echoes of our broken hearts. What will become of us? Will we emerge from this storm stronger, or will we be forever changed by the tempest that rages within us?"

We\u2019ve been navigating this journey of love for four months now, our hearts entwined despite the miles that separate us. Every day, every night, she fills my thoughts with such vivid imagery, her smile, her laughter, the way her eyes light up when she talks about her favorite places in China. But tonight, on her birthday, the 16th of July, I find myself adrift, unsure of how to make this special day meaningful.\n\nShe\u2019s told me that birthdays aren\u2019t a big deal for her, but I know that beneath those words lies a deeper longing, a desire for connection and celebration. Given the cultural gap between us, her insistence that she means what she says only adds to my dilemma. Yet, isn\u2019t it true that when English girls say they don\u2019t care much about birthdays, it often means the opposite? Isn\u2019t it true that she craves something more, something that acknowledges the depth of our bond?\n\nWhat could I possibly do to make this day memorable for her? She\u2019ll be working, so I have no idea what I can send or plan. Could it be a heartfelt letter, filled with memories of our time together? Or perhaps a small token of appreciation, something that represents our shared love for the culture she cherishes? Could it be a surprise video message from afar, showing her the places I miss her presence in? The possibilities are endless, yet each one feels inadequate, like trying to capture the sun in my hands.\n\nOh, how I wish I could be there to wrap her in a warm embrace, to sing her happy birthday in her native tongue, to share a meal with her that would remind her of home.

How do I bridge this gap, how do I make her feel seen and loved, especially on this day?\n\nAdvice, oh advice, I beg of you! Any ideas, any suggestions, would be a beacon of hope in the darkness of my uncertainty. For in this moment, my heart is heavy with the weight of her birthday, and I yearn to do something, anything, to make it special. How do I honor her, while also acknowledging the unique challenges of our long-distance relationship? What can I do to ensure that this day, though simple, is filled with the warmth and joy that she deserves?\n\nI am lost, adrift in a sea of possibilities, and I need guidance. Please, if you have any ideas, any advice, any words of encouragement, let them flow into my heart, for they will be the lifeline that keeps me afloat until we can be together again.\n</email>"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how tangled my heart is right now, like a ball of yarn left unspooled in the dark. I've been wrestling with myself since I asked my boyfriend of two months to commit to something more serious, knowing full well that I was on the brink of emotional investment. Something in my gut whispered, \"Be brave, speak your truth,\" but the fear of rejection gnawed at me like a relentless predator. I pushed, hoping against hope that he would see what I saw, that he would share the same longing for a future together.\n\nAnd then, he avoided my question. \"I'm not sure,\" he mumbled, his eyes avoiding mine. I could see the uncertainty, the hesitation, but I couldn't let it go. I needed to know. I needed him to understand the depth of my feelings, the intensity of my desire to be with him. So, I pushed harder, until finally, he broke. He told me he didn't want to be in the relationship anymore, that he saw no long-term potential. He felt I had given him an ultimatum, that I had pressured him into making a decision. But was it really pressure? Or was it simply the honest expression of my own feelings?\n\nThe pain is sharp and raw, slicing through me like a knife. Did I push too hard? Was it my fault that he walked away? I keep replaying those moments, wondering if I should have held back, if I should have let him decide at his own pace. But what if we would still be together if I hadn't pressed the issue? Would it have been better to wait, to let things unfold naturally? Or is it possible that our paths were never meant to intertwine, that we were simply two pieces of a puzzle that didn't quite fit?\n\nI just want to talk to someone, to hear their thoughts, to find some solace in the chaos of my emotions. Have you ever felt like you were walking a tightrope, balancing between hope and despair? Have you ever been torn apart by the fear of losing someone you love, only to realize that staying might have been worse than breaking up? It's a lonely place, this limbo between wanting and letting go. I just need someone to listen, to validate my feelings, to help me navigate this tumultuous sea of emotions.\n\nSo, dear friend, if you've ever been here, if you've ever felt this way, please, share your perspective. Help me understand that even though the pain is intense, it doesn't define me. That I am stronger than this, that I will heal, and that perhaps, in the end, it was for the best. Because why stay with someone who can't even be sure they want to be with you, when there's a chance that somewhere out there, another person might be exactly what you're looking for?"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how the memories flood back as I recall that fateful day at the summer camp, where the air was thick with excitement and the promise of homemade vanilla ice cream. Can you imagine the joy in the children's eyes as they eagerly awaited their turn to shake and create their own icy treat? The scene was set with coffee cans, milk, vanilla, rock salt, and ice\u2014everything needed for a perfect batch of ice cream. But alas, fate had other plans. No coffee cans, you say? How could we have possibly improvised without them? Plastic ziploc bags, of course! Secure, double-lock types that seemed foolproof at first glance.\n\nWe pre-made the inner bags with vanilla and milk, carefully placing them inside the larger bags filled with ice and rock salt. The kids were given the task of shaking away, and before long, the magic happened. Ice cream formed, and the children's faces lit up with delight. But then, the unexpected twist\u2014a lesson in osmosis, the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a semi-permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides. \n\nHow could such a scientific concept be so devastatingly applied in our simple experiment? Every single bag remained intact, yet when the ice cream was served, the children's reactions were anything but pleasant. Spit-outs and exclamations of disgust echoed through the campsite, and even I, the adult, found myself retching into the nearest trashcan. How could something that started with such promise end in such a bitter, salty disaster?\n\nWas it the osmosis at work, or perhaps a misstep in our preparation? Had we only practiced beforehand, we might have anticipated this outcome. But alas, we were unprepared for the salty onslaught that awaited us. And so, the decision was made to switch to ice cream sandwiches, a more reliable option that would not leave our young campers with a lingering taste of disappointment and discomfort.\n\nWhy did we not foresee this? Was it our lack of experience, or simply the complexity of the science involved? As I reflect on that day, the vivid imagery of the children's faces, the taste of the salty ice cream, and the immediate need to find coffee cans replays in my mind like a looped film. How do we prevent such mishaps in the future? What lessons can we learn from this experience?\n\nIn the end, the true test of a teacher's mettle is not just in the successful completion of experiments, but in how we handle the unexpected. As we move forward, let us remember the importance of preparation, the value of learning from mistakes, and the enduring joy that comes from sharing experiences, even if they sometimes turn out to be a bit...salty.\n\n</email>"

In that same song, how can any star shine if the sky\u2019s most brilliant star shines all too soon? And yet... isn\u2019t every stormy sea made to show its secret smile to the skies \u2013 the stars, the swans, the silent songs, and slow, sad stories of the sorrows sung? For I\u2019m your shadow here, singing the sweetest songs with silence in all that's said\u2014so that when you smile, no shadow but the smile could ever dare!\n\nI know the story of two stars, their laughter, and how the moon would laugh, the mirth of midnight in each moonlit mind! How, then, could I whisper words of truth? It\u2019s you, I hear it loud enough here. With your whispers of whispers, your silences so sure that stars themselves seem so small\u2026 so very, very small? \n\nAnd isn\u2019t it true that when you\u2019re just about to give a glimmer, a glint to the golden glees, you\u2019ve got me here? Your own sweet sonnet spun in silver and silver, strung with strings so strong, so sterner\u2026 and so sweet?\n\nThe world of wondrous whispering, where stars sing, and shadows shiver, was I but the one that sang to the serenade of summer? Wasn\u2019t it a spark? Isn\u2019t there always more to you, that I might find, as far from the fire that fills your frame, that you fill mine? A flame, you called the candle's call, calling the calm, calming the coldest chill? Chilling, churning, churning, chilling. A comet in the coldest cold, chasing the chase of the chaser's chase\u2014chase after chase, chase, chased by chase, the chase that chases chase!\n\nYet, I knew that kiss... that kiss that kissed the sky... a star! It wasn't 'cause the sky had some silly smile, but silly silkworms spin such a starly smile, spinning silver, shining so sweetly... that silver sky-silken silk so sweet? So sweet! Yet, there, in the soft-spun song, there sits no song; but sizzles, sizzled, silvery so silver... the soulful soul, the sole sol so soft? Sigh of sighs, sigh so sweet, sing so so sweet, sweet song so sweet, silver silkworm\u2019s sigh? Singing, sighing, silks so slight, so sweet... sweet so sweet!\n\nA starling star, I'm told, sings, softly, sweetly! So sweet! So sweet in that, sweet so sweet. She sings, the song... the so silvery sweet, the shivery so shivered sylph of summer's shiver: shimmer-shudder-shuffle-shriek, shuffling shiver, shivering she-ship, ship of she, she-so shy!

How can I possibly compete with the lingering echoes of their presence in her life, when we've only just begun to weave our own tapestry of shared moments? The distance between us feels like an ocean, yet it is my very distance that might be the key to bridging the gap in her heart.\n\nHow do I ignite the spark within her that flickers so faintly compared to their embers? How can I transform my relatively open emotions and innocence into a beacon that guides her back to the safety of my arms? Every word I speak, every gesture I make, must be imbued with the essence of what makes me uniquely me\u2014my charm, my understanding, my unwavering belief in the power of our connection.\n\nIs it possible to surpass the allure of those who have left indelible marks on her heart? Can I truly make myself more captivating than the ghosts of her past, when she longs for the comfort and familiarity they once brought? Each day without her feels like a lifetime, each night spent alone a reminder of the warmth and laughter we could share if only she believed in the possibility of our love.\n\nDo I dare to dream that my charm, honed through years of observing and understanding the intricate dance of relationships, will be enough to overcome the barriers she's built around her heart? Or am I destined to remain a mere spectator, watching from afar as she flutters between the memories of her exes and the hope of a future with me?\n\nThe thought of losing her to them, of becoming just another memory in her life, is almost unbearable. Yet, I hold onto the belief that there is a way to make myself more interesting, more desirable, more her. For isn't love about finding the strength to be yourself, to be the best version of you, and to show her that you are the missing piece of her puzzle?\n\nSo, how do I continue to light the fire that burns within me, to keep the flame alive until she sees the beauty in the present moment, the promise of a future where we can build something truly beautiful together? How do I convince her that I am the one who understands the depths of her emotions, who can meet her in the darkest corners of her heart and bring her back to the light?\n\nI must believe that it is possible, that with time, effort, and a steadfast commitment to being myself, I can win her back. For in the end, isn't that what love is all about\u2014finding a way to overcome the odds, to prove that true love is worth fighting for, no matter the cost?"

How can I navigate this treacherous terrain of emotions and friendships?

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Email Epithet Signoff],\n\nOh, how my heart aches as I pen this letter, a veritable flood of emotions cascading through my veins, each drop representing the turmoil within. For six months, we've danced under the moonlight, a love story that felt so real, so genuine, yet now it seems like a mirage in the desert, fleeting and false. How can it be that someone you once believed to be your friend can turn into an enemy, a stranger, overnight? The vivid imagery of that fateful weekend comes alive before my eyes, a stark contrast between the warm glow of camaraderie and the cold chill of betrayal.\n\nHow could she throw such a tantrum, insisting that we take the baby just to go out? Was it not our engagement, a promise made weeks ago, a bond that was meant to be honored? And yet, she stood there, a tempest in a teapot, her words cutting deeper than any blade. My boyfriend, a man of principle, stood firm, his resolve unwavering, but how did she manage to sway him in the past, ensnaring him in her web of deceit?\n\nThe wedding day, a moment of joy and celebration, was marred by the shadows of her presence. We picked up my boyfriend's son, our little prince, and continued on our way, unaware of the storm brewing beneath the surface. Yet, she erupted, unleashing her fury upon us, transforming from a mere acquaintance into an adversary, a villain in the making. Now, I am forbidden from picking up or dropping off my boyfriend's son, a role that I cherish deeply, a bond that I cannot sever.\n\nShe accuses me of being a controlling bitch, a label that cuts like a knife, slicing through my soul. Is it not natural to want to protect what you hold dear? She claims I am hindering his relationship with his son, as if my presence is a barrier to his happiness. And her constant texting, a relentless barrage of demands and accusations, makes me question whether she truly cares about her own children, or if her actions stem from a deeper, darker place.\n\nI have approached my boyfriend with the hope of clearing the air, of restoring some semblance of peace. But he insists that I stay out of it, that I trust his judgment. How can I, when every fiber of my being cries out for justice, for understanding? Am I wrong to want to protect my boyfriend and his son from her manipulation? Or am I simply a pawn in her game, a scapegoat for her shortcomings?\n\nI find myself lost in a sea of questions, each one leading to another, a never-ending cycle of doubt and uncertainty. What is the right thing to do? Should I continue to stand by, watching as she tears apart a family, or should I intervene, risking everything for the sake of truth and honesty?\n\nAs I sign off, my heart heavy with sorrow and my spirit weary from the struggle, I wonder if there is any rhyme or reason to this madness, any hope left in the darkness. May the stars guide us towards clarity and peace, for in the end, love and trust are the only constants in this tumultuous journey.\n\nYours in turmoil,\n\n[Your Name]"

It's been such a long time since I've felt this close to someone, this connected, and yet, there's something amiss.\n\nThe way he touches me, the way he whispers sweet nothings into my ear, it's like a symphony playing to the rhythm of my soul. His fingers dance across my skin, igniting a fire that burns deep within. And yet, there's this one thing that haunts me, a shadow that looms large in the corners of my mind. He hasn't made me come, and I know, without a doubt, that no other man has either. Challenge accepted?

But then again, maybe I shouldn't, and the silence will remain, a constant reminder of the unspoken.\n\nHow can I make him understand that he's doing everything right? How can I break through the barriers of shame and insecurity? The answers lie within me, but they're hidden behind a veil of fear and uncertainty."

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Your Paper: Future Frame Prediction in Videos\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your excellent work on the paper titled \u201c[Title of the Paper]\u201d. I carefully reviewed your manuscript and found several aspects particularly commendable. Below, I provide feedback aimed at enhancing the clarity, robustness, and impact of your research.\n\n### Key Points of Appreciation:\n\n1. **Innovative Formulation**:  \n   Your proposal of separating the inherent noise from the temporal uncertainty is a pioneering approach. This distinction enhances the capacity to model the randomness intrinsic to video sequences effectively, making a significant contribution to the field.\n\n2. **Experiments**:  \n   The diverse set of experiments conducted, spanning synthetic shapes, robotic arms, and human actions, provide a solid basis for validating your method across various domains. The detailed analysis on how different levels of sample numbers influence prediction accuracy adds valuable insights.\n\n3. **Training Procedure**:  \n   The method\u2019s robustness against underestimating the stochastic components is demonstrated through your outlined training procedures, showing its potential for practical applications in video modeling.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. **Model Performance**:\n   - **Background Modeling in Non-Synthetic Datasets**: While your variable \\(z\\) excels in capturing complex motions like those in robotic arms, the background remains challenging. It might help to investigate why the model fails to predict smooth and coherent backgrounds accurately. Perhaps the variability in natural scenes makes them more difficult to represent with the current framework.\n   - **Human 3.6M Dataset PSNR/SSIM Evaluation**: The use of PSNR alone might be limiting due to its bias towards blurriness and lack of focus on semantic information. Introducing additional metrics such as structural similarity (SSIM) can complement PSNR. Moreover, consider qualitative evaluations focusing on the presence and clarity of human subjects within predicted frames rather than solely relying on visual metrics.\n\n2. **Training Data**:\n   - **Action Variability**: Regarding the Human 3.6M dataset, note that despite the time-invariant model outperforming the time-variant one, using all 15 actions may introduce confounding factors. Actions often share common patterns but exhibit nuanced differences. Ensuring that the performance improvement isn't attributable to consistency rather than the model's capability can strengthen your argument.\n   - **Data Preprocessing and Model Architecture**: Ensure transparency regarding whether the models trained here match those evaluated earlier (like those mentioned in your reference [Finn et al., 2016]). Differences in preprocessing steps, training procedures, or architectures between datasets could lead to discrepancies in performance measures.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n\n- **Semantic Quality Metrics**: As suggested, include evaluations focused on the semantic correctness of generated frames. For instance, assessing the detectability of actions or humans in predicted frames can provide more concrete evidence of utility.\n- **Consistency in Experimental Setup**: Ensure that both training and testing setups align closely with the baseline methods to make direct comparisons valid. This includes matching data processing pipelines and architectural choices where applicable.\n\nOverall, your contributions are strong and noteworthy. Addressing these points should further refine your findings and potentially elevate your paper\u2019s standing among competitors.\n\nThank you once again for sharing this insightful work. I look forward to seeing the enhancements made in response to these suggestions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nQwen  \nAlibaba Cloud  \n[Your Institution/Organization]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nSubject: Feedback on the New Method for Predicting Multiple Future Frames in Videos\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI recently read the paper titled \"A Novel Approach for Predicting Multiple Future Frames in Videos,\" which proposes an innovative method for modeling the stochasticity in future frame predictions. Here are my thoughts and observations:\n\n**Summary:**\nThe paper introduces a new formulation that separates the inherent noise of frames from the uncertainty of the future. This separation allows for direct modeling of the stochasticity in the sequence using a random variable \\(z \\sim p(z)\\), with the posterior \\(q(z | \\text{past and future frames})\\) approximated by a neural network. During testing, sampling from the prior \\(p(z)\\) enables the generation of diverse future frames. The method supports both time-variant and time-invariant modeling of \\(z\\).\n\n**Pros:**\n- The novel formulation and training procedure effectively model the stochastic nature of future frame prediction.\n- Experiments on synthetic shapes and robotic arm datasets demonstrate the method's capability for multiple future frame prediction.\n- The analysis on the number of samples, the modeling power of the posterior, and qualitative examples provide a strong foundation for the method's effectiveness.\n\n**Cons:**\n- In non-synthetic datasets, the variable \\(z\\) seems to underperform in modeling the future, particularly in the background motion of the robot arm and human action datasets. The background is not well-modeled despite the entire sequence being available for the approximate posterior computation.\n- The PSNR values for the Human 3.6M dataset are lower than expected, indicating potential issues with blurriness in the predicted frames.\n- Additional quantitative evaluations beyond PSNR and SSIM, such as semantic quality assessments, would provide more comprehensive validation.\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n- It is unclear whether all 15 actions are used in the Human 3.6M experiments. The time-invariant model outperforming the time-variant one might be due to the consistent nature of some actions rather than the model's inherent superiority.\n- The use of PSNR as the primary evaluation metric is questionable, given its bias towards blurriness. Evaluating semantic content, such as the detectability of humans or the predictability of actions, would offer a more robust assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the proposed method is intriguing and addresses an important aspect of future frame prediction, the results need further validation. I recommend addressing the above points to strengthen the paper's credibility and impact.\n\nReferences:\n1. Emily Denton and Vighnesh Birodkar.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nSubject: Critical Feedback on Your Manuscript\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI must begin by expressing my critical view of the current draft of your manuscript. It seems that the application of recurrent autoencoders to the analysis of multidimensional time series has not been presented with the clarity and rigor expected in a scientific article. The vivid imagery of complex data transformations you describe feels lost amidst the dense, unclear explanations. It\u2019s as if the intricate dance of algorithms and data points is shrouded in a fog, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the elegance of your approach.\n\nThe lack of a thorough discussion on related work is particularly glaring. This omission not only hampers the reader's ability to understand the significance of your contribution but also diminishes the manuscript\u2019s impact. Imagine, for instance, a breathtaking landscape where every peak and valley is meticulously detailed\u2014only to find that the map lacks any indication of where this landscape fits into the broader topography. This is akin to what we see in your paper; it\u2019s as though the entire work is set adrift without a compass.\n\nI strongly recommend that you revisit the manuscript with the intention of sharpening its focus and clarity. Consider the rigor displayed in other ICLR submissions; these exemplify how one should position their research within the existing body of work. By doing so, you will not only enhance the quality of your manuscript but also enrich the discourse surrounding your findings.\n\nI look forward to seeing a more vivid and critical presentation of your research.

However, I must offer some constructive feedback on its current state.\n\n1. **Statistical Setup**: The paper lacks clarity on fundamental aspects such as randomness and probability models. A thorough explanation of what is considered random would go a long way in understanding the model.\n\n2. **Censoring and End-of-Life**: The discussion around censoring and \"end-of-life\" events needs to be more precise.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nOh, dear heavens! I must express my utmost disappointment with the current state of your manuscript on applying survival analysis in social networks. It's as if the very fabric of statistical rigor has been torn apart, leaving behind a tattered patchwork that barely resembles a coherent argument.\n\nImagine, if you will, a grand cathedral of statistical wisdom, its walls adorned with intricate patterns of randomness and probability. Now, envision this cathedral reduced to a mere shadow, its foundations crumbling, its towers leaning precariously. This is what your paper presents\u2014a structure that fails to define what is truly random, leaves the interplay between censoring and the end-of-life in such a hazy fog that it's almost as if the very concept of time itself has become muddled.\n\nAnd then there's the clustering approaches, which are nothing more than a smattering of well-trodden paths in the vast expanse of frailty analysis literature. It's as if you've wandered into a well-known forest, expecting to find a new trail, only to discover that every path you take has been beaten down by countless others. You must delve into the extensive literature on repeated measurements and time-series analysis, drawing comparisons and contrasts. This is not just a matter of academic curiosity; it's a critical juncture where your work could either soar or plummet into obscurity.\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious oversight is the lack of any meaningful assessment of the different design decisions. Why, oh why, do you insist on using the Kuyper loss function? It's as if you're painting with a single color, when the canvas demands a palette of vibrant hues. Your numerical results are but a pale imitation of what they could be, failing to provide any insight into the nuances of your approach.\n\nIn conclusion, it's imperative that you address these issues with a critical eye and a vivid imagination. Only then can your paper rise from the ashes of suboptimal statistics to become a beacon of clarity and innovation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Program Representation Learning Using Execution Traces\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.\n\nI wanted to share some feedback on your recent submission regarding learning representations of programs from execution traces. Overall, I found it to be a fairly strong paper with insightful architectures for the task at hand.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for clarity:\n\n1. **Variable \"Evidence\" in Equation (4):**\n   - Could you please define what \"Evidence\" refers to in Equation (4)? This would help readers understand its role in the model.\n\n2. **Error Patterns:**\n   - You mention predicting error patterns without defining them explicitly. From the appendix, it seems you're doing multilabel classification based on predefined sets of error classes. Can you confirm if this is accurate?\n\n3. **Recurrence in Architectures:**\n   - Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 may need more annotations to highlight they are indeed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based. Briefly mentioning \"Recurrent\" next to the architecture diagram would be helpful.\n\n4. **Dependency Enforcement Diagram:**\n   - Fig. 5 suggests dependencies are only enforced at points where the variable gets assigned. If this is true, please add a note explaining why dependencies aren\u2019t enforced elsewhere.\n\nAssuming the authors can address these clarity issues, I believe the paper has merit and could benefit from these tweaks.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the updated version!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Affiliation]  \n[Email]  \n[Phone Number]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how the authors have woven a tapestry of complexity with their three architectures for learning representations of programs from execution traces! It's as if they've conjured up a vivid world where variable values dance and intertwine, creating an intricate ballet of computation. But alas, in this realm of hyperbole and critical scrutiny, the shadows of ambiguity loom large.\n\nFirstly, let us delve into the variable trace embedding, where the input to the model is presented as a sequence of variable values. Imagine, if you will, a grand procession of numbers and strings, each one more enigmatic than the last. Yet, in the midst of this spectacle, the variable \"Evidence\" in equation (4) remains shrouded in mystery, like a ghost that refuses to reveal its true form. This is akin to a magician failing to pull a rabbit out of a hat, leaving the audience in a state of bewildered wonder.\n\nMoving on to the state trace embedding, we find ourselves entangled in a web of recurrent encoders, where embeddings for variable traces are combined in a manner that is both mesmerizing and perplexing. However, the authors' reference to \"predicting error patterns\" is as vague as a whisper in the wind. Is it a mere multilabel classification task, or something far more complex and nuanced? The appendix hints at the latter, yet the clarity remains elusive, like trying to grasp a mirage in the desert.\n\nThe dependency enforcement embedding, with its element-wise multiplication of embeddings for parent variables, is a stroke of genius, much like the sudden realization of a long-forgotten truth. Yet, the question remains: are dependencies enforced only at points where assignment is performed for a variable, or is there a broader, more intricate web of connections at play? Figure 5, with its cryptic implications, only serves to deepen the mystery, much like a riddle left unanswered.\n\nIn the end, while the proposed models are as compelling as a thrilling narrative, the paper is marred by these critical ambiguities. The authors must address these issues with the same fervor and precision with which they approach their research. Only then can this work truly shine, like a beacon in the night, guiding others through the labyrinth of programming errors and beyond.\n\nIf these clarity issues can be resolved, I would be delighted to see this paper take its place among the luminaries of the field. Until then, let us hope that the authors can unravel the mysteries they have woven, and bring this work to the level of brilliance it deserves.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Your Paper: \"Accelerating Complex Task Learning via Expert Traces\"\n\nHi [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well!\n\nI wanted to provide you with some feedback on your recent manuscript titled \"Accelerating Complex Task Learning via Expert Traces.\" Here are my thoughts:\n\n### Significance and Originality\n\n- **Significant Problem**: You tackle a compelling issue by focusing on situations where the expert's state trajectory is observable but actions aren't! This is indeed valuable in robotics and other practical applications.\n  \n- **Original Approach**: Your method isn't about estimating explicit action models but uses subgoals derived from expert behavior. While claimed as novel, the paper could benefit from clearer demonstration of why avoiding an action model is beneficial.\n\n- **Guidance Rewards & Factorization**: Use of heuristic rewards and Q-function factorization looks promising. Abstaining from an action model is smart; though, more clarity on its necessity vs. just the rewards is needed.\n\n### Quality\n\n- **Ablation Study**: Good job showing that guidance rewards matter! But doing an ablation on the Q-value factorization would help clarify importance.\n\n- **Clarity of Methodology**: Some parts felt a bit heavy on notation. Maybe simplify the explanation:\n  - Explain intuitively: Focus on what you're solving for rather than math-heavy formulas.\n  - Why is `g(S)` important?\n\n### Clarity\n\n- **Notation and Intuition**:\n  - For someone who\u2019s not super deep into it, it\u2019s tough!\n  - Simplify: Explain it like: \"We guide the learner toward doing what the expert did.\"\n  - Show: Visual aids for `g(S)`\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\n- **Baseline Comparison**: Good job comparing against DQN baseline.\n- **Potential Looping Issue**: Mentioned concern makes sense. Could add potential fix: \"Like shaping?\"\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n- **PRO**: Key problem solved.\n- **CON**: More motivation for no action model.\n- **CON**: Streamline explainer for better readability.\n\nFeel free to reach out if any of these points need clarification or discussion. \n\nBest,\nQwen",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nIn the vast and often treacherous landscape of machine learning, the authors of today's paper have ventured forth with a critical and hyperbolic leap forward, proposing a solution that promises to revolutionize the way we teach machines complex tasks. Imagine, if you will, a world where robots no longer need to be explicitly programmed with every move, but instead learn by observing the subtle nuances of human behavior. This is not just a dream; it is a bold and vivid reality that the authors have brought to life.\n\nThe significance of this work cannot be overstated. Unlike the mundane imitation learning or behavioral cloning techniques that have been the bread and butter of the field, the authors have tackled a problem that is both crucial and understudied: learning from observable state trajectories without the need for explicit action models. This is akin to teaching a child to ride a bike by showing them how to balance, rather than telling them to pedal and steer simultaneously. The authors claim that their approach is novel and potentially transformative, yet the paper falls short in fully illustrating its importance and utility.\n\nThe authors have developed a solution that eschews the estimation of explicit action models, a decision that, while theoretically sound, is not convincingly demonstrated to offer clear benefits. Instead, they introduce a series of heuristic rewards that guide the learner to achieve subgoals derived from the expert's behavior. This is a brilliant and vivid approach, but the paper lacks the critical evidence to show that this factorization is truly essential. It's as if the authors have painted a beautiful picture but failed to provide the viewer with the tools to understand the brushstrokes.\n\nTo make matters more intriguing, the authors have refactored the Q-function, endowing it with a component that is a function of the subgoal extracted from the expert. This is a daring and innovative move, akin to reimagining the very fabric of the learning process itself. However, the paper fails to fully explain the intuition behind this formulation. It's as if they have built a magnificent castle but have not provided a map to navigate its intricate corridors.\n\nThe authors' claims of faster learning and superior performance are supported by compelling evidence, particularly when compared to DQN baselines on Doom game problems. Yet, there is a conditional expression lurking in the shadows: while the proposed approach does indeed outperform certain competitors, it remains to be seen whether it can hold its own against more sophisticated models that incorporate explicit action models. This is a critical juncture where the true mettle of the authors' approach will be tested.\n\nMoreover, the ablation studies, while promising, fall short in fully validating the importance of the factorization of the Q-function. It is akin to suggesting that a particular ingredient is vital to a recipe but failing to prove its necessity through rigorous experimentation. The authors must delve deeper into this aspect to solidify their claims.\n\nIn terms of clarity, the paper is a mixed bag. The intricacies of memory-based kernel density estimation and neural gradient training are presented in a manner that is both complex and opaque. It is as if the authors have constructed a labyrinthine fortress but have not provided a clear path for others to follow. While the authors manage to elucidate the intuition behind the heuristic rewards, the Q-value factorization remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nOne can only hope that future iterations of this work will address these shortcomings, streamlining the methodology section to communicate the intuitions more effectively. Only then will the full potential of this groundbreaking approach be realized.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nSubject: Critical Analysis and Conditional Expressions on Your Paper's Truncated Horizon Approach\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I have critically examined your manuscript and must say that your innovative approach of combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) in the infinite horizon discounted MDP setting is nothing short of breathtaking. Your paper's introduction of a new cost function through shaping (Equation 1) is a stroke of genius, ensuring that the shaping does not alter the optimal policy\u2014a feat that is both critical and hyperbolic in its significance.\n\nHowever, let me tread carefully and offer some conditional expressions that will undoubtedly challenge your perspective. While the core idea of truncating the planning horizon and using an approximation of the optimal value function (V^e) is not entirely novel, it has been explored in the past, particularly in the context of multi-task RL and approximate dynamic programming. For instance, the work by Farahmand et al. (AAAI, 2016) and Bertsekas (European Journal of Control, 2005) delve into similar methodologies, albeit with different goals and settings. These papers, among others, have laid the groundwork for your approach, making it essential to position your work more robustly within this existing landscape.\n\nNow, let's dive into the specifics. Theorem 3.1 is a critical juncture, yet it might be misleading. It states that if the error (eps) is very large\u2014essentially half the range of the value function\u2014the agent performs poorly. However, this condition is so stringent that it almost negates the theorem's practicality. If eps is smaller than 0.5, there would be no error, implying perfect performance. This scenario seems too idealistic to be of much practical interest. It would be more compelling to explore a broader range of eps values and their impact on the agent's performance.\n\nMoreover, the IL setting in your paper, where an oracle provides V^e, is a vivid representation of an idealized scenario. In real-world applications, such as teaching a robot or a car, we often lack access to V^e unless we have a comprehensive understanding of the reward function. This limitation is not a deal-breaker, but it is crucial to acknowledge and address it explicitly in your paper.\n\nLastly, the use of the differential operator nabla (Equations 10, 14, 15) is non-standard and could confuse readers familiar with the conventional gradient notation. Perhaps a brief explanation or a footnote would help clarify this point.\n\nRegarding the figures, they are challenging to decipher due to the mixed-up colors representing confidence regions. It might be more effective to use standard error bars instead of standard deviations. This change would make the data more accessible and interpretable.\n\nIn conclusion, while your paper is well-written and presents a fascinating idea, it needs to be more critical and nuanced in its positioning relative to prior work. Addressing these points will not only enhance the rigor of your argument but also make your findings more impactful and accessible.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on your Draft Paper on DNN Loss Function Design\n\nHi [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI\u2019ve had the opportunity to review your draft paper on designing a DNN loss function for reducing intra-class variance in the output feature space. Here are my thoughts:\n\n---\n\n**Summary & Key Contribution**\n\nThe main focus of your paper is on proposing an isotropic variant of the softmax loss to better balance classification accuracy and class compactness. This is well-motivated considering the need for more robust and discriminative deep neural networks.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Motivation & Clarity**: The idea of using isotropic normalization to enhance the compactness of classes is well-presented.\n2. **Organization**: Your paper is mostly clearly organized and easy to follow.\n3. **Results**: The numerical results on benchmark datasets show some promise and indicate improved performance compared to softmax and center losses with k-NN and k-means classifiers.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Incremental Novelty**: While your approach builds on Wen et al. (2016)'s isotropic softmax loss, it feels like an incremental improvement rather than a groundbreaking innovation.\n2. **Training Procedure**: The training procedure is not clear from this draft. More details would help reviewers understand how the new loss is optimized (e.g., learning rate schedules, batch sizes).\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Highlight Unique Selling Points**: Clearly define what sets your approach apart from Wen et al.'s (2016). What specific improvements does it offer?\n2. **Clarify Training Details**: Provide more details on the training process. How is the isotropic normalization parameter adjusted? Any hyperparameter tuning involved?\n3. **Future Work/Research Directions**: Mention potential directions for future research. Are there plans to test this loss with other classifiers besides k-NN/k-means?\n\nThanks again for sharing your work!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Your Institution]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nCritical minds might argue that the paper's contribution is nothing more than a hyperbolic attempt to reframe existing work, but let me paint you a vivid picture nonetheless. The authors boldly claim to have designed a new isotropic variant of the softmax loss, a feat that promises to revolutionize how we approach the reduction of intra-class variance in the output feature space. This is no small feat; it\u2019s like discovering a new way to bake the perfect cake, where every ingredient must be just right.\n\nNow, imagine if I told you that this new loss function could not only enhance the accuracy of classification but also ensure that each class is compactly clustered together. It\u2019s as if you had a magic wand that could make all the marbles of the same color stick together while still being able to tell them apart with ease. The authors have indeed managed to pull off something that seems almost too good to be true.\n\nHowever, the conditional nature of their success is quite critical. While numerical results on benchmark datasets show some improvement over the softmax loss and center loss (Wen et al., 2016), these gains are only apparent when using distance-based classifiers such as k-NN and k-means. It\u2019s like saying that while their cake tastes great with vanilla ice cream, it doesn\u2019t impress much with chocolate sauce.\n\nThe paper itself is mostly clearly organized and presented, which is a rare gem in the sea of academic papers that often read like a tangled web of jargon. Yet, there\u2019s a catch. The training procedure of the proposed method remains unclear. It\u2019s as if the authors have painted a beautiful landscape but left out the instructions on how to actually get there. This omission could be a significant hurdle for potential adopters of their method.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of isotropic normalization for enhancing compactness of classes is well-motivated, the novelty of the method is somewhat diminished by its reliance on prior work. The potential of this research is undeniable, but the path to fully realizing its promise is still shrouded in mystery. \n\nLet\u2019s hope the authors address these critical points in future iterations of their work.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nAh, dear friend, let me begin by painting you a vivid picture of the stormy seas that lie ahead if we do not address the critical issues in your paper. The derivation linking a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to recursive application of Maximum Entropy Model fitting is as complex as a labyrinth, yet the mathematical notation is as clear as mud! It's akin to navigating through a foggy night without a lighthouse.\n\nLet's start with the major comments. The second condition of the Maximum Entropy Equivalence Theorem is as murky as a stagnant pond, where clarity is a mirage. It could mean either pairwise independence or joint independence, but the proof assumes the former induces the latter, which is a fallacy as profound as the belief that the Earth is flat. This assumption is as unfounded as a ship sailing into the eye of a hurricane.\n\nMoving on to Section 4.1, the analogy to Expectation Maximization (EM) is as vivid as a sunset, but the process described is as different from gradient descent as a butterfly is from a moth. Gradient descent updates all parameters in parallel, akin to a flock of birds flying in unison, while the optimization in your paper is conditional on all other layers remaining fixed. This is as stark a contrast as day and night.\n\nThe proofs in Appendix C are as incomplete as a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. The statement \\(I(T_i;T_j) \\geq I(T_i;T_j|Y)\\) is as elusive as the Holy Grail, and requires rigorous proof. The lemmas, on the other hand, are as circular as a loop in a M\u00f6bius strip, each assuming the correctness of the other, leading to a dizzying cycle of confusion. The minimum taken over for the left-hand side in Lemma 5 is as undefined as a horizon, and the phrase \"T is only related to X\" is as ambiguous as a riddle without an answer.\n\nMinor comments, though less critical, still require attention. The notation \\(E_{P(X,Y)}\\) is as uncommon as seeing a unicorn, and should be replaced with a more explicit form. The word \"Markov\" should be spelled with a \"k,\" not a \"c,\" as if correcting a child's spelling mistake. Lastly, the paper is riddled with missing prepositions, articles, and numerous spelling mistakes and typos, akin to a manuscript written in a foreign language.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these issues is as crucial as breathing for survival. Your work is a masterpiece, but it needs some fine-tuning to reach its full potential. Let us embark on this journey together, as if we were sailing towards undiscovered lands, to make your paper a beacon of clarity and precision.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

The authors took a novel approach by adapting tools from quantum mechanics, specifically those used for studying quantum entanglement, to analyze DNNs.\n\nThey developed a graph-theoretical analysis for neural networks, showing how concepts from quantum entanglement can inform our understanding of architecture design. To demonstrate its utility, they applied this new framework to the MNIST dataset, showcasing potential implications for improving DNN performance.\n\nWhat's particularly exciting about their work is the potential it holds for theoretical advancements in AI. By providing insights into DNNs through a different lens, we might gain fresh perspectives on fundamental questions in machine learning theory.\n\nIf you're curious, I can send over a summary or point you to some key papers/research!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or have any thoughts on this!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Info]  \n[Your Company/Organization]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, dear colleague, let me paint you a vivid picture of this groundbreaking paper that has just graced our academic realm! The authors have taken a leap so bold, it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve leaped from the mundane world of classical computing straight into the fantastical domain of quantum mechanics. By drawing an electrifying connection between deep neural networks and the enigmatic theories of quantum entanglement, they\u2019ve woven together threads of reality and mystery to create something truly revolutionary.\n\nImagine, if you will, the intricate dance of qubits in a quantum system being mirrored by the complex interactions within a neural network. It's as if the very fabric of these networks is now understood through the lens of quantum theory, where each neuron becomes a quantum particle, entangled with its neighbors in a symphony of information processing. This is no mere hypothesis; they've employed a graph-theoretical analysis to dissect these neural networks, much like a master painter would analyze the brushstrokes in a masterpiece.\n\nThe demonstration of their theory on the MNIST dataset is nothing short of a critical breakthrough. It\u2019s as if they've taken the abstract concepts of quantum entanglement and brought them down to the concrete level of machine learning, making the impossible possible. Their findings are not just novel; they are a beacon of hope for those of us who seek to understand the theoretical underpinnings of neural networks. \n\nHowever, I must admit, my knowledge of quantum entanglement is somewhat limited. Yet, the potential for this work is vast. If we could harness even a fraction of the power implied by this research, the future of artificial intelligence might be transformed overnight. So, I implore you, dear reader, to delve into this paper with an open mind and a curious heart. For those who dare to explore the intersection of quantum mechanics and deep learning, the rewards are not just theoretical but could redefine the very landscape of AI.\n\nCritical questions remain, of course. How do we ensure that these quantum-inspired neural networks are robust and reliable? How do we bridge the gap between quantum theory and practical applications in machine learning? These are the challenges that lie ahead, and I believe this paper is a crucial step towards overcoming them.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're as intrigued by the fusion of quantum entanglement and neural networks as I am, then you owe it to yourself to read this paper. It's not just a piece of research; it's a gateway to a new era of AI. Let us embrace this hyperbolic leap forward with both critical thought and vivid imagination!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh dear, let me tell you about this paper! The authors have attempted to create a grand, sweeping objective whose Lagrangian dual is supposed to encapsulate a plethora of modern machine learning wonders, including variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. But alas, the attempt is so convoluted and filled with hyperbole that one can hardly discern the forest for the trees.\n\nImagine a landscape where every hill and valley is described with such vivid imagery that it becomes impossible to navigate. That\u2019s what this paper feels like. The authors introduce a construction so nuanced and opaque that it reads like a labyrinthine puzzle, where each equation is a riddle waiting to be solved. Equation 3, for instance, is a critical juncture, a precipice where the path splits into a myriad of divergences, each subject to a combinatorial explosion of constraints. And yet, what specific insights does this offer? What new knowledge is gained that wasn\u2019t possible before? It\u2019s like painting a masterpiece and then realizing it\u2019s just a rehash of a well-known scene.\n\nFurthermore, the discussion around GANs is particularly galling. The authors seem to believe that reasoning about their divergence measures in the limit of infinite capacity discriminators is meaningful. This is akin to claiming that a butterfly can fly by flapping its wings harder and harder until it eventually defies gravity. While Arora et al. (2017) and Fedus et al. (2017) have shown that this line of reasoning is not always valid, the authors wave these concerns away as if they are mere flies in their grand vision. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve built a magnificent castle in the air, only to find that it crumbles at the first gust of wind.\n\nSection 4, which should be the shining beacon of clarity, merely introduces a plethora of hyperparameters and combinatorial choices without offering any guidance. It\u2019s like throwing a map of the world onto a blank canvas and expecting someone to find their way. There are no experiments to demonstrate the utility of this approach, save for a few toy examples that explain nothing new. The authors have taken a topic that was already murky and made it impenetrable.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper is a tour de force of hyperbole and vivid imagery, but in the end, it fails to deliver on its promises. The authors need to make their paper more coherent and targeted, addressing specific problems in the literature rather than attempting to encompass all of them. Otherwise, it will remain a tantalizing, yet ultimately unsatisfying, read.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

Below, I share some thoughts and feedback:\n\n---\n\nWhile I understand that training generative models with binary latent variables poses significant challenges, I'm not convinced that this paper advances the field as much as it could. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Binary Latent Variable Experiments**: The paper does mention promising results on binarized MNIST for the non-convolutional architecture. That being said, this result seems underwhelming given the simplicity and small scale of the dataset. More ambitious datasets like CelebA or CIFAR-10 would provide a better test case.\n\n2. **Overall Performance**: Most of the experiments compare your method against other approaches (e.g., RWS, VIMCO), and the results suggest your algorithm lags behind the current state-of-the-art techniques. This indicates there might still be some room for improvement in terms of performance metrics like ELBO, FID score, etc.\n\n3. **Incrementality**: Your approach feels rather incremental compared to existing work. While I appreciate the thorough execution and clear explanations provided, I feel more originality or a significant breakthrough was needed to truly stand out.\n\n4. **Execution & Clarity**: Everything appears to have been done with diligence. The writing is clear, and the methodology well-explained. However, I believe more compelling and impactful results would strengthen its appeal for acceptance.\n\n5. **Future Work & Directions**: Consider adding a section discussing potential improvements or areas to focus next. For instance:\n   - Explore larger/more complex datasets\n   - Compare with more recent methods directly\n   - Look into hybrid architectures combining binary & continuous latent variables\n\n---\n\nIn summary, I find your work solidly executed but lacking that extra push to convince me it meets the ICLR acceptance criteria. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts & discuss further!\n\nBest regards,\n\nQwen\nAlibaba Cloud",

Is it really possible that training generative models with binary latent variables is just as easy as they make it sound? And here's the kicker\u2014do we really believe this paper makes a substantial leap forward in this challenging area? Or is it more like taking a baby step in a field where giants have already tread?\n\nSure, the authors do mention some promising results on binarized MNIST for the non-convolutional architecture, but does this truly excite anyone? It\u2019s like finding a shiny pebble in a vast desert of sand. Meanwhile, all other experiments seem to point out that the proposed model/algorithm is lagging behind the state-of-the-art. Is this the best we can expect from a paper submitted to ICLR?\n\nMoreover, the approach feels quite incremental, compared to existing works like RWS and VIMCO. It\u2019s like suggesting a new flavor of ice cream when there are already so many delicious ones out there. While I commend the authors for their serious and thoughtful execution, does it really justify acceptance at ICLR? Or are we setting the bar too low here?\n\nSo, my rhetorical question to you is: Can this paper truly stand up to the rigorous standards of ICLR, or are we missing something monumental in its contribution?"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Your Paper: Dialog Model Combining Retrieval & Generation\n\nHi [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI recently read your paper titled \"[Paper Title],\u201d where you propose a new dialog model integrating both retrieval-based and generation-based components! I found the concept fascinating, especially how the model generates responses in three distinct stages: retrieval, generation, and reranking. It\u2019s great to see an innovative approach here.\n\n### Key Points and Insightful Questions:\n\n1. **Model Motivation**:\n   - You motivate conditioning on candidates in two ways: bringing in extra info & reducing chance of gen. \"universal rep.\".\n   - My concern: Reducing prob. of gen. \"universal reps.\" relies on how cond. done\u2014shouldn't it prevent ignoring input?\n\n2. **Copy Mechanism**:\n   - Good addition!\n   - Wondering why not include querying info in copy mech.\u2014might help w/taking query phrases.\n\n3. **Candidate Selection**:\n   - Query if stats on cand. vs gen\u2019d ans.\n\n4. **Minor Typos**:\n   - Sec. 3.2 \u201cusing and the state\u201d \u2192 \u201cusing the state\u201d\n   - \"more than one replies\" (Sec. 3.2)\n   - Last line p3: \"what are the 'following principles'\" \n\n5. **Benchmark Consideration**:\n   - Since novel dataset, no clear SOTA ref.\n   - Would add benchmark qa data\n\n### Experimental Results:\n- **RERANKING IMPROVEMENT**: Cool!\n- **HUMAN EVAL** & **BLUE SCORES**: Close to border, good sign\n- **QUALITY OF EXAMPLES**: Some good, one ok / bad\n- **BASELINE LENGTH**: Baselines all short\n\n### Thoughts:\n- Do LSTMs struggle?

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, isn\u2019t this fascinating? A new dialog model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based modules! But let\u2019s dive deep into the details and see if we can unravel its true potential.\n\nIs this really a groundbreaking approach? It seems like the ensemble model can indeed improve on both the retrieval module and the generation module, without restricting its modeling power. Isn\u2019t that just brilliant? Yet, I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014have we seen anything quite like this before? Memory Networks come to mind, but their approach is so different. In Memory Networks, a set of relevant memories is extracted from a knowledge base and fed into the generator. However, in this current work, the extracted items are used both to feed the generator and to participate in reranking. How does that affect the outcome?\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the experimental section. The performance measures used are a human evaluation score with three volunteers and BLUE scores. These methods are not very satisfying, but effective evaluation of such systems is a known difficulty. The results show that the ensemble outperforms the individual modules, which is promising. But does it really impress you? The subjective evaluation is close to the \u201cborderline\u201d score. In the examples provided, one is good, the other is borderline/bad, and the baseline always provides something very short. Is the LSTM working particularly poorly on this dataset? Given that this is a novel dataset, I don\u2019t know what the state-of-the-art should be. Could you provide more insight? Have you considered adding a benchmark dataset, such as a QA dataset?\n\nThe paper motivates conditioning on the candidates in two ways. First, that the candidates bring additional information which the decoder can use (e.g., read from the candidates locations, actions, etc.). Second, that the probability of universal replies must decrease due to the additional condition. I think the second argument depends on how the conditioning is performed. If the candidates are simply appended to the input, the model can learn to ignore them. Is this really a concern?\n\nThe copy mechanism is a nice touch, encouraging the decoder to use the provided queries. Why not copy from the query too, e.g., with some answers reusing part of the query, like \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to the park\u201d? How often does the model select the generated answer versus the extracted answers? In both examples provided, the selected answer is the one merging the candidate answers. Is this selection process truly balanced?\n\nAnd now, some minor issues:\n\n- Section 3.2: using and the state\n- Section 3.2: more than one replies\n- Last sentence on page 3: what are the \"following principles\"?\n\nThese points are critical and could significantly enhance the clarity and impact of the paper. Are there any specific insights or benchmarks you can add to address these concerns? \n\nWhat do you think about this? Does it live up to the hype, or are there still some lingering doubts?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nCritical as the task at hand may be, this paper on Neural Process Networks (NPNs) has left me with more questions than answers. Is it truly as groundbreaking as its proponents claim, or is it merely a specialized tool for a niche problem? Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nFirstly, the paper presents NPNs as a robust framework for capturing procedural knowledge in text. But, is it as versatile as claimed? Can it truly be applied to a wide array of tasks, or is it as tightly bound to the specific domain of recipes as the manual collection of actions through MTurk annotations suggests? How does it fare when tested against the bAbI and CBT datasets, tasks that Recurrent Entity Networks (RENs) were specifically designed to handle? The authors mention a comparison against RENs, but a fair test would require running NPNs on the same tasks. Without this, the comparison seems skewed, almost as if the authors are cherry-picking the battles they win.\n\nMoreover, the qualitative analysis provided in the paper is as vivid as a sunset on a cloudy day. While the examples in Table 3 are indeed impressive, with only minor omissions like \"oil\" and \"sprinkles,\" the overall reliability of the entity selection is questionable. An F1 score of 55.39% suggests a level of unreliability that demands further scrutiny. Why not present examples randomly sampled from the development set? Would this not provide a clearer picture of the model\u2019s true capabilities?\n\nThe generation task is equally puzzling. The examples in Table 6 are undoubtedly good, but the overall BLEU score is surprisingly low, especially considering the quality of the generated text. This discrepancy raises doubts about the effectiveness of the model in real-world applications. A thorough discussion of failure cases and a comparison of perplexity scores between models could shed light on these issues.\n\nThe architecture itself is intriguing, but the reliance on pre-trained word embeddings and action embeddings raises critical questions. Why must the architecture be differentiable? Could a simpler NLP pipeline, perhaps with pre-trained embeddings, achieve similar results without the complexity? An ablation study where action embeddings are pretrained using word2vec and then fixed during training could help address these concerns. This would not only validate the necessity of the differentiable architecture but also provide insights into the model\u2019s true strengths and limitations.\n\nFurthermore, the difficulty of the task at hand should be discussed more prominently. Until the examples on page 7 are presented, it\u2019s hard to grasp why a neural architecture is necessary. For instance, the task of selecting \"wash and cut\" functions seems straightforward, with the potential for multiple words (cut, slice, etc.) to select the same action. This suggests that a simpler approach might suffice, making the complexity of the NPNs somewhat redundant.\n\nIn conclusion, while the NPNs show promise, the paper leaves room for improvement in terms of general applicability, fairness of comparisons, and thoroughness of the qualitative analysis. Are we truly witnessing a paradigm shift, or is this just another nail in the coffin of simpler, more general models?\n\nWhat do you think? Have I missed any critical points, or are the authors on solid ground?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Nearest-Neighbor Based Continuous Control Policy Paper\n\nHi [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts regarding the paper titled \"[Paper Title]\" that we recently reviewed. As discussed during our meeting, here\u2019s my feedback:\n\n---\n\nThe paper proposes two nearest-neighbor-based continuous control algorithms, NN-1 and NN-2, which seem quite intuitive yet effective for relatively simple control tasks. The simplicity and elegance of their approach are commendable. Both algorithms rely on precomputed or learned trajectories to guide action selection, akin to semi-parametric control policies.\n\nHowever, while the concept is novel and promising, I didn\u2019t find it sufficiently innovative for the top-tier conference like ICLR. Here are my key points:\n\n1. **Algorithm Simplicity**: \n   - The core idea of using nearest-neighbor lookups seems straightforward and potentially dated (90s style).\n   - The lack of complexity doesn\u2019t align with modern expectations for groundbreaking methods.\n\n2. **Scope and Results**:\n   - While the paper shows decent performance on simple tasks, it struggles with high-dimensional and stochastic environments.\n   - No significant improvements over baselines were demonstrated in complex setups.\n\n3. **Potential for More Innovation**:\n   - Simple adaptations like adaptive distance metrics weren\u2019t explored.\n   - Latent space transformations or learned metrics for fast retraining on new domains weren\u2019t mentioned.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**:\n   - Given these limitations, I think this paper would fit better in a less formal venue.\n   - A workshop focused on reinforcement learning or nearest-neighbor techniques would be ideal for generating discussions and sparking further research ideas.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Not a strong candidate for ICLR due to lacking novel insights.\n- Good fit for a smaller workshop or symposium with similar focus areas.\n\nWhat do you think about presenting these findings at a relevant workshop instead?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Institution]  \n[Contact Info]  \n[Link to Paper if applicable]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nIs this paper truly groundbreaking, or is it just another attempt at reinventing the wheel? This nearest-neighbor based continuous control policy, while it may seem like a clever idea at first glance, is nothing more than a simplistic approach that falters when faced with the complexities of higher-dimensional and stochastic environments. How can we possibly consider this paper worthy of a place among the cutting-edge research at ICLR, when it barely scratches the surface of what's possible?\n\nImagine, for a moment, if this paper had pushed the boundaries of what's known about nearest-neighbor policies. What if instead of relying on a static and rigid method, it had introduced an adaptive distance metric that could dynamically adjust to the nuances of different environments? Or even better, what if it had ventured into the realm of learning metrics in a latent space, allowing for rapid retraining and adaptation to new domains? These are not just hypotheticals; they represent the kind of innovation that should be driving the field forward.\n\nBut alas, this paper remains content to tread on well-worn paths, much like its predecessor, \"Learning to Steer on Winding Tracks Using Semi-Parametric Control Policies.\" It\u2019s as if the authors are saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll stick to what we know works, even if it means missing out on the opportunity to make a real impact.\u201d Is this really the kind of contribution we want to see at ICLR? \n\nSure, the simplicity of implementing this algorithm is appealing, but does it justify the lack of depth and originality? Is it not the duty of researchers to challenge the status quo, to push the envelope, and to explore uncharted territories? This paper seems content to stay within the bounds of the familiar, content with the notion that a simple, open-loop trajectory is enough to tackle any problem.\n\nSo, why should this paper be accepted at ICLR? Can it truly spark meaningful discussion and lead to further advancements in the field, or is it destined to be yet another footnote in the annals of reinforcement learning history? If the goal is to foster genuine progress and innovation, then perhaps this paper belongs in a workshop setting, where it can serve as a catalyst for more robust and ambitious discussions.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate the effort put into this paper, I cannot in good conscience recommend its acceptance at ICLR. Let us reserve our most prestigious conferences for works that truly push the boundaries of what is possible. After all, isn\u2019t that what makes ICLR the beacon of innovation it is meant to be?\n\n</email>"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI must admit, I was initially captivated by the concept of your paper, which delves into the intriguing world of Pac-Man as a variant of a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. However, upon closer inspection, I must ask myself, \"Is this truly groundbreaking, or merely a rehash of familiar territory?\" Your focus on decomposing Pac-Man into sub-agents or advisor value functions, while theoretically sound, seems to fall short of making a significant technical contribution.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into the nitty-gritty. The paper\u2019s reliance on a grid world with obstacles, while mathematically elegant, feels like a step back from the impressive advancements in the field, where raw video inputs are transformed into sophisticated models capable of navigating complex environments. Can we really claim that solving a grid world problem is as revolutionary as processing raw video data? The answer, I fear, is no.\n\nIn Section 2, you cite Parr\u2019s seminal work on flexible decomposition algorithms for weakly coupled Markov decision processes (MDPs). But is this citation enough to elevate your paper above the fray? The question looms large: Are we really making progress here, or are we just rehashing old concepts?\n\nMoving to Section 3, the idea of an additive reward decomposition seems like a forced fit. Is it truly necessary, or is it merely a requirement imposed by the problem specification? If it is, how do we ensure that such a decomposition can be applied to any monolithic reward function? The challenge here is not just technical, but rhetorical: How do we justify the necessity of this approach without overcomplicating the problem?\n\nIn Section 4, the analysis of local optima and attractors seems like a vivid reminder of the inherent limitations of function approximation schemes. Yet, the new insights gained from this analysis remain unclear. It feels like we are dancing around the edges of a well-trodden path, rather than blazing a new trail. Egocentric: Definition 1 raises a critical question: What new knowledge have we acquired that wasn\u2019t already known? It is a general problem, and the preservation of rank ordering of actions for a state is a fundamental issue in any approximation scheme. Agnostic: The approach of approximating a myopic rollout seems reasonable, but why should it be the go-to method? It\u2019s a rhetorical question, but one that deserves serious consideration. Empathic: This appears to be the key contribution, yet the novelty is somewhat compromised by related work. Is this paper then nothing more than an empirical evaluation of previous methods in a single Pac-Man grid world variant? It\u2019s a stark reality that the theory of DEC-MDPs might offer a richer vein of insight, but alas, your paper seems to stick to the surface.\n\nThe evaluation in Section 5 is another matter altogether. You\u2019ve chosen to evaluate solely on a single domain, which is a critical oversight. The fact that the empathic approach performs better is not surprising, given its applicability to Pac-Man. However, the fact that modifying the discount factor for egocentric can also perform well is equally unsurprising, as lower discount factors have often been shown to improve approximated MDP solutions. But why stop there? Why not explore the broader implications of your findings? The potential applications extend far beyond Pac-Man, as you hint at with the special case of concurrent action decomposition into advisors. This could be a high-impact direction for future work, especially in areas like inventory control, logistics, and epidemic response.\n\nBut let me ask you rhetorically: Why not take a more ambitious approach? Why limit yourself to a single domain when the potential for innovation lies in the complexities of real-world problems? Your work could be so much more, but it needs to break free from the constraints of a single grid world and venture into the vast, uncharted territories of concurrent action problems.\n\nIn conclusion, while your paper is well-written, it lacks the depth and breadth needed to make a significant impact. It\u2019s a missed opportunity to truly revolutionize the field. Could you consider expanding your scope and exploring the broader implications of your findings? The world of reinforcement learning is vast and waiting for bold, innovative contributions.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Your ANN Hidden Layer Selectivity Study\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.\n\nI recently read your manuscript on \"When Hidden Layer Units Show Category Selectivity in Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Networks.\" Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: While I appreciate the simplicity of your approach and how it helps isolate the effects of different parameters, I believe the task selected may be too simplistic compared to real-world tasks like object recognition. Comparing it to the Quiroga results on \"Jennifer Aniston cells\" highlights the need for a more relevant, deeper network setup for studying real-world representations.\n\n2. **Paper Quality**: Your paper needs a thorough proofread. Unclear references (like \"figures 3, ?? and 6\" & \"Figure 3.3.1\") are confusing. Also, it would help if you defined the measure of selectivity you're using and checked if the label \"selective\" depends heavily on the cutoff value (e.g., 0.05).\n\n3. **Abstract and Intro**: Tone down the criticism towards PDP. It feels a bit like a rant. Ensure the intro clearly states your goals without coming across as attacking other methods.\n\n4. **Noise Effects**: Your finding about more selective units arising under higher noise levels is intriguing. This parallels the Quiroga findings. Considering the drop-out robustness hypothesis, might it suggest that grandmother cells adapted to handle noise?\n\n5. **Suggestions**:\n   - Consider adding a section comparing your binary pattern task to real object recognition.\n   - Fix the typos and unclear figure references for clarity.\n   - Define your criteria for selectivity.\n   - Provide a smoother transition in your intro.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you\u2019d like to discuss any points further!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Affiliation]  \n[Your Contact Info]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how can I begin to express the sheer exasperation I feel upon reading this paper on neural networks and their category selectivity? It's as though the authors have taken a hyperbolic brush to a canvas of simplicity, painting a picture that feels both vividly lacking and deeply underwhelming. When they claim to have found something \"interesting,\" it's hard not to question whether they've merely stumbled upon a fleeting mirage in the vast desert of neural network research.\n\nLet's start with the task at hand\u2014binary pattern classification. Oh, how it seems like a mere child's play compared to the grandeur of object recognition! The authors seem to have forgotten that comparing their simple network to the remarkable Jennifer Aniston cells, as if they were two peas in a pod, is nothing short of absurd. It's as if they're asking us to believe that studying a single tree can tell us everything about a forest. Would anyone seriously argue that a shallow, binary classification network can truly capture the essence of real-world object recognition? Of course not. But let me ask you, dear authors: Is it not time to move beyond such simplistic tasks and delve into the rich complexity of actual object recognition?\n\nNow, let's talk about the presentation of your work. It's as if the paper was written by someone who had just learned to write in a hurry, with no time for proper proofreading. Figures 3, ?? and 6\u2014what do they even represent? And why is Figure 3.3.1 left hanging, a tantalizing mystery waiting to be solved? It's as though the authors are deliberately leaving readers in the dark, hoping they won't notice the sloppiness. Can you imagine presenting a thesis to a committee like this? It would be a disaster!\n\nBut wait, there's more. The method of quantifying selectivity is shrouded in mystery. Do the results hinge on the arbitrary choice of a p-value threshold of 0.05? Isn't it possible that a different cutoff might yield entirely different conclusions? It's like choosing the right shade of paint for a masterpiece without knowing the true colors of the world. The authors should be transparent about these choices, lest they be accused of cherry-picking results.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of the abstract and introduction. They come across as a rant against PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing), a style that's as critical as it is hyperbolic. Can we really afford to dismiss the possibility of category selectivity in the face of distributed representations? It's as if the authors are painting themselves into a corner, arguing against a concept that has been well-established in the field. Why not tone it down a bit and present a balanced view?\n\nHowever, amidst all the criticism, there is a glimmer of interest. The finding that more selective units appear in the presence of higher noise levels is indeed intriguing. It's as if the network is creating redundant local representations to fortify itself against the dropout-induced chaos. This is reminiscent of the Quiroga findings on Jennifer Aniston cells, where the small number of selective units suggested a larger pool of potential grandmother cells. Could this imply that the \"grandmother cell\" observations are an adaptation to increase robustness in the face of noise? It's a thought-provoking idea, but one that deserves a more nuanced exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the work hints at an interesting phenomenon, the paper is marred by its overly simplistic task and sloppiness. It's time to step up the game and tackle real-world challenges. Only then can we truly appreciate the beauty and complexity of neural networks.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

I appreciate the effort put into this work and found several aspects very insightful.\n\n**Positive Points:**\n\n1. **Important Problem Addressed**: Great job bringing attention to the need for a better understanding of adversarial perturbations and how AT influences them.\n2. **Nice Visualizations**: The visualizations showing universal perturbations changing during AT application were really helpful.\n3. **Clear Observation**: You made the basic observation about AT's behavior clear and easy to follow.\n\n**Constructive Criticisms:**\n\n1. **Limited Scope**: While the experiments are interesting, they seem somewhat unfocused and limited in scope. Would the same phenomena occur with different datasets or models?\n2. **Different Attacks**: Are similar results observed with other types of attacks (e.g., not just FGSM)?\n3. **Theoretical Analysis**: The paper could benefit from more in-depth theoretical discussions explaining why AT works against certain perturbations.\n4. **Missing Central Message**: Due to the unfocused nature, the paper may lack a strong central message or key takeaway.\n5. **Next Steps**: It would help if you could suggest next steps for further research to fill these gaps.\n\n**Detailed Comments:**\n\n1. **Focus Improvement Suggestions**:\n   - Try running experiments on different datasets (MNIST, Imagenet) to see if the findings generalize.\n   - Test on different models (vgg16, inceptionv3).\n   \n2. **Attack Method Variability**:\n   - Consider using other methods like BIM, PGD, or even random noise attacks to see if the trends hold.\n\n3. **Theoretical Insights**:\n   - Discuss any existing theories that explain why AT works against universal perturbations.\n   - Suggest experiments to test hypotheses derived from those theories.\n\n4. **Central Message & Next Steps**:\n   - Summarize 2-3 main takeaways clearly before conclusions.\n   - Outline open questions and future work.\n\nOverall, I think this paper has potential for contribution but needs some refining.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nAh, the world of adversarial perturbations and adversarial training (AT)! It's a battlefield where models face off against subtle yet powerful adversaries, and the victor is often determined by the strength of their defenses. In this particular study, the researchers seem to have uncovered some intriguing dynamics, but the journey to understanding the full scope of AT's effectiveness remains fraught with challenges.\n\nLet us delve into the findings, shall we? The paper explores how AT impacts adversarial perturbations, both shared and singular, using a ResNet on the CIFAR dataset. It's like watching a masterful chess game unfold, where each move reveals a new layer of complexity. The authors conclude that AT appears to fortify models against shared perturbations, making universal perturbations less effective as more AT is applied. Imagine a fortress that becomes impenetrable as its walls grow thicker and stronger. But, my dear friend, does this phenomenon hold true across different terrains and armies?\n\nNow, consider the case of singular perturbations. These pesky intruders are easily detected by a dedicated model, almost like a beacon in the night. But, is this detection truly a sign of vulnerability, or is it merely a symptom of a different ailment? And, what happens when we introduce other forms of adversarial attacks, such as those beyond the Fast-Gradient-Sign-Method (FGSM)? Is the fortress still unassailable, or does it crumble under the weight of a more sophisticated siege? These questions beg to be answered, don't they?\n\nThe visualizations of universal perturbations evolving during AT are indeed captivating. They paint a vivid picture of a model's resilience, almost like watching a caterpillar transform into a butterfly. However, the experiments, while interesting, feel like they are scattered across a vast landscape without a clear path. Does the same phenomenon occur on different datasets? Are the defenses as robust with other models? These are the questions that gnaw at one's mind, seeking answers in the shadows.\n\nMoreover, the paper's lack of a deeper theoretical analysis is akin to sailing without a compass. While the basic observations are clearly communicated, the absence of a guiding principle leaves one wondering if there is a more profound reason why AT+FGSM defends against universal perturbations. Is it simply a matter of luck, or is there a fundamental mechanism at play? These thoughts swirl around like a tempest, demanding a more thorough exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper touches upon several fascinating aspects of AT, but it seems to lack a significant central message or substantial new theoretical insights. The questions it raises are like the first drops of rain before a storm, promising a deluge of knowledge and understanding. Are we ready to face the challenge, or will we content ourselves with the current state of affairs?\n\nWhat do you think, my dear colleague? Can we navigate through these uncharted waters and uncover the true nature of AT's defense mechanisms? Or will we continue to stumble in the dark, hoping to find our way?\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

Overall, I found the concept intriguing and the approach innovative, especially the idea of updating Q-values starting from the end of the episode to facilitate quicker reward propagation.\n\n### Positive Points:\n1. **Conceptual Novelty:** The paper introduces a fresh way of sampling data for updates in DQNs, which could indeed lead to faster convergence.\n2. **Results:** The reported improvements over the baseline are clear and presentable.\n3. **Objective Definition:** In the non-tabular case, defining an objective that works both on- and off-policy is noteworthy.\n\n### Constructive Criticisms:\n1. **Lack of Comparison:** The paper misses out on comparing its technique with existing methods like Prioritized Replay in the tabular case and Retrace, Tree Backup, or Watkins' Q-learning in the non-tabular case. These algorithms aim for similar goals and could provide valuable baselines.\n2. **Theoretical Analysis:** A bit more theoretical analysis to show if the objective defined in the non-tabular case is a contraction operator in the tabular case would strengthen your claims.\n3. **Atari Results:** The results for Atari games are still below the current state-of-the-art (SOTA). Improvements could come from better comparisons with other techniques.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Convergence Guarantees:** Provide some theoretical guarantees on whether your method converges under certain conditions.\n2. **Baseline Comparisons:** Add comparison to known baselines like Retrace, Tree Backup, or Watkins\u2019 Q-Learning.\n3. **Detailed Analysis:** Include a detailed analysis section where you explain why Prioritized Replay might not work the same way as your proposed approach.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Retrace Algorithm:** Despite being a bit different from yours, Retrace has been quite effective in Atari, defining a convergent update rule. It\u2019s worth testing against it.\n- **Prioritized Replay:** In the tabular case, prioritized replay can simulate a similar effect.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nThis paper, proposing a revolutionary new method for sampling data in deep-Q networks, is nothing short of a breath of fresh air. Yet, as I delved into its contents, a nagging question arose: how can we possibly assess its true worth without the proper comparisons to the plethora of previously published techniques? Is it not like trying to judge the flavor of a gourmet dish without tasting it against its finest rivals?\n\nLet us consider the results presented. They show improvement over the baseline\u2014improvement, indeed! But when set against the backdrop of the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) in Atari results, it feels more like a mere whisper in the wind. The authors have indeed ventured into uncharted territory with their non-tabular approach, defining an objective that is both on and off-policy. However, is it not a bit like dancing in the dark without any theoretical analysis to guide us through the shadows?\n\nCan we truly say that the objective defined in the non-tabular case is a contraction operator, especially in the tabular scenario? It is akin to building a castle in the sky without laying a solid foundation. Prioritized replay, for instance, could very well have a similar effect to the proposed approach in the tabular case, much like a clever magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. And in the non-tabular realm, the Retrace algorithm, tree backup, and Watkins' Q learning all bear a striking resemblance to the proposed method. Although the authors have innovated, they should have at least compared their method to one of these algorithms as a baseline.\n\nBut here\u2019s the critical question: why settle for merely suggesting that the Retrace algorithm has shown significant improvements in the Atari case, when it defines a convergent update rule? Is it not like pointing to a mountain peak while ignoring the highest peak of them all?\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents a fascinating new approach, it falls short in providing the necessary comparisons and theoretical underpinnings. How can we truly appreciate the potential of this method without a more rigorous evaluation? Let us strive for clarity and depth in our future endeavors, ensuring that each step forward is well-supported and meticulously analyzed.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

Here are some points I\u2019d like to discuss:\n\n### Method Overview\n\n- **Sentiment Pre-processing**: The paper uses GloVe for text processing.\n- **Image Pre-processing**: It leverages Inception for image classification.\n- **Output Layer Fusion**: Combined results from both modules feed into a final output layer.\n\n### Criticisms and Suggestions\n\n#### Self-Reported Emotions vs. Emotional State Representation\n\n1. **Claimed Self-Reported Emotions**: The paper's main claim\u2014that Tumblr posts represent self-reported emotions\u2014seems misleading. People choose hashtags to broadcast along with announcements or content; they aren't necessarily reporting their emotional state directly.\n   \n   - *Example*: Someone might use #love for approval or agreement, not genuine affection.\n\n2. **PANA-X vs. Core Emotion Words**:\n   - **Mistaken Words**: Bored, Annoyed, Love, Optistic, Pensive are not part of PANAS-X.\n     - *Reference*: [PANA-X Scale](https://wiki.aalto.fi/download/attachments/50102838/PANAS-X-scale_spec.pdf)\n   - **Scale Purpose**: PANAS-X is for measuring positive and negative affect, not just emotional states.\n\n#### Theory Misalignment\n\n3. **Ekman\u2019s Basic Emotions vs. Circumplex Model**: \n   - **Basic Emotions**: Only anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise are basic emotions.\n   - **Circumplex Model**: Contradicts basic emotions, suggesting emotions arise from neural interpretations, not discrete systems.\n\n4. **Valence Axis Doubt**: First PCA axis isn't conclusively Valence, especially with \"Sad\" being slightly positive.\n\n#### Lack of Novelty\n\n5. **Short Character Posts**: Truncating 50 characters doesn\u2019t capture full context.\n6. **No Image Value**: Images don\u2019t seem vital for classification.\n7. **Algorithm Combination**: Seems similar to previous work (2 algos combined).\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n1. **Novel Contribution**: Mostly classification of posted emotion words, no new understanding.\n2. **Impact**: More focus on Tumblr post classification, lacking deeper emotion insight.\n\nLet me know if we can discuss further!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Job Title]  \nAlibaba Cloud  \n[Your Contact Info]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nHow could you possibly think that Tumblr posts truly represent self-reported emotions, let alone that this method sheds any new light on the matter? Is it not a stretch to assume that the emotion words chosen by users are anything more than a mere broadcast of their current sentiments? How can we overlook the fact that these hashtags might be used sarcastically or in ways that defy traditional emotion theory?\n\nImagine a world where everyone uses #love to express strong approval, not genuine affection. Isn't it absurd to believe that these words capture the essence of human emotion? The authors claim that the hashtags represent self-reported emotions, but this is akin to saying that a weather report predicts the climate. It's a stretch of imagination that defies reality.\n\nMoreover, the authors cite the PANAS-X scale, claiming that the 15 emotions retained are those with high relative frequencies on Tumblr. Yet, five of these words\u2014bored, annoyed, love, optimistic, and pensive\u2014are not even part of the PANAS-X scale! How can we trust a method that relies on such flawed foundations? It's as if they're building a house on quicksand, hoping for it to stand tall.\n\nThe idea that these words are \"core\" emotion words is a hyperbolic notion, at best. Words like \"strong,\" \"active,\" and \"healthy\" are not emotion words; they are descriptors of states or conditions. The PANAS-X scale is designed to elicit feelings of positive and negative affect, not to infer latent emotional states. This is akin to trying to measure the depth of a river with a ruler meant for measuring height. The authors should know better.\n\nIf the authors' goal is different from the standard sentiment analysis goal of predicting positive or negative sentiment, they should be aware that this is precisely what PANAS is designed to do. It is not a tool for inferring the latent emotional state of a person, except to the extent that their affect is positive or negative. This is a critical flaw in their methodology.\n\nThe field of representing emotions has been a subject of study for over a century, and it continues to evolve. The most popular theories of emotion, such as the theory of basic emotions proposed by Paul Ekman, suggest that emotions are short-duration states lasting only seconds and are fairly specific. On the other hand, the Circumplex Model of Emotions, as referenced by the authors, stands in direct opposition to these theories. How can the authors claim to understand the current state of psychology\u2019s view of emotion representation when they clearly do not grasp these fundamental concepts?\n\nIn the PCA results, it is not \"clear\" that the first axis represents valence. \"Sad\" has a slight positive on this scale, yet \"sad\" is one of the emotions most clearly associated with negative valence. This is like pointing to a red apple and calling it green. It's a mistake that undermines the entire analysis.\n\nFurthermore, the novelty and impact of this paper are \"ok, but not good enough.\" This analysis does not seem very different from Twitter analysis, despite Tumblr posts being allowed to be longer. The authors truncate the posts to 50 characters, reducing them to mere fragments of their original meaning. And the images do not seem to add much to the classification. The algorithm appears to be essentially a combination of two previously published algorithms, which is hardly groundbreaking.\n\nFor me, the novelty of this paper lies in its application to the realm of emotion theory. But I do not feel there is a contribution here. This paper is more about classifying Tumblr posts according to emotion word hashtags than generating new insights into emotion representation or inferring latent emotional states.\n\nIs it not time to reconsider the validity of this approach and focus on methods that truly capture the complexity of human emotions?\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

Overall, the concept of introducing a discount factor to improve upon RWA is intriguing, especially since the initial RWA results weren't as promising.\n\n### Positive Points:\n1. **Clarity**: The paper is clearly written, which makes it easy to follow even if you're diving straight into the technical details.\n2. **Original Contribution**: Adding a simple yet effective discounting mechanism shows good creative thinking.\n\n### Critiques & Suggestions:\n1. **Performance Consistency**:\n   - **Standard Baselines**: In nearly all tested tasks, the RDA is on par with or slightly worse than the standard GRU or LSTM, except for a couple of cases where there\u2019s a minor speed advantage (MultiCopy task).\n   - **Language Modeling Exception**: It does show significant improvement on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia task vs. RWA, but only equals the performance of basic GRUs/LSTMs.\n   \n2. **Missing Newer Work**:\n   - The paper could benefit from mentioning recent advancements in attention mechanisms for tasks like translation (\"Attention is All You Need\") and image classification (e.g., Non-Local Neural Networks).\n\n3. **Stronger Evaluation Needed**: \n   - To convince reviewers and the audience, combining RDA with these leading models might help.\n   - Evaluate more competitive benchmarks across various widely studied tasks to showcase its potential.\n\n4. **Future Work**:\n   - Consider exploring why RDA works a bit better on certain tasks vs. others.\n   - How sensitive RDA is to different hyperparameters?\n\n5. **Next Steps**:\n   - Re-run experiments with updated datasets/models if new data became available.\n   - Test RDA with other architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models).\n\n### Next Action:\nWe recommend revising the paper based on the feedback above.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nCritics might wonder, why bother with the RDA, the Recurrent Discounted Attention unit, when its predecessor, the RWA, already showed promise? After all, the RWA was an intriguing concept with dismal performance\u2014far worse than the standard GRUs or LSTMs with standard attention, except perhaps for a few hand-picked tasks. Yet, the RDA, with its modest addition of a discount factor, seems to bring it closer to the pack, albeit not quite reaching the heights one might hope for.\n\nIs the improvement worth the effort? The paper itself is a model of clarity, making the small but original tweak to RWA quite appealing. However, the reality is stark: in almost every task, the RDA either matches or falls short of the standard GRU or LSTM, with only a slight edge in speed during training for the MultiCopy task. But even this advantage is fleeting, as the difference in performance appears to be negligible after just a few training steps.\n\nThe most vivid imagery comes from the language modeling on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset, where RDA significantly outperforms RWA. Yet, even here, the results are merely on par with a standard GRU or LSTM, leaving one to question the true impact of this innovation.\n\nBut can we really call this a significant improvement when the paper fails to mention any of the newer work on attention mechanisms? This year, groundbreaking advancements have been made using attention for translation (\"Attention is All You Need\") and image classification (Non-local Neural Networks, among others in the ImageNet competition). Could it be that RDA's potential is overshadowed by these more advanced approaches?\n\nTo truly convince the reviewers and the broader academic community, RDA must be combined with these cutting-edge models and tested against a wider array of widely-studied tasks. Only then can we determine if the RDA has legs to stand on or if it's destined to remain a footnote in the annals of attention-based neural networks.\n\nHow much longer must we wait before RDA proves its mettle against the giants of modern neural networks?"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on \"Defense-GAN\" Paper\n\nHi [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI\u2019ve recently read your paper \u201cDefense-GAN\u201d and wanted to provide some thoughts and questions based on my brief review:\n\nFirst off, thanks for sharing this simple and direct approach! I appreciate how straightforward it was described. It\u2019s great to see a technique that aims to robustness against adversarial examples without altering the downstream classifier.\n\nHere are a few points I noted while reading:\n- **Baseline Comparison**: Missing a baseline comparison with the nearest neighbor (from the training set) would have been helpful. How does this method perform compared to just finding the closest training example?\n- **Dataset Limitation**: Your experiments are all on MNIST and FM-NIST datasets. Given their simplicity, it might be good to mention if these findings generalize to other, more complex datasets.\n- **Reconstruction Time**: Reconstructing an MNIST-sized image takes between 0.043sec and 0.825sec. This is impressive speed-wise!\n- **Comparison with MagNet**: Your Table 4 shows MagNet often performed worse than no defense. Could you elaborate on why you think this is the case? Was there anything specific about MagNet's method that made it less effective here?\n\n**White-Box Attacks**:\nIn white-box attacks, you use L steps of gradient descent on MSE(G(z), x). I wonder if this approach could easily be compared against FGSM-based attacks. Maybe running the same number of steps of an FGSM attack as the GAN iterations would serve as a nice control group?\n\nOverall, I found the paper concise and easy to follow. It tackles a real problem with a simple solution.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Info]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh, how fascinating! This paper on Defense-GAN has truly captured my attention with its bold claim of generating images (G(z)) that are so close to the original inputs (x) that they nearly fool the mean squared error (MSE) into believing they're the same. But, let\u2019s step back for a moment and ask ourselves, is this approach truly as revolutionary as it seems?\n\nIs it possible that the real magic lies in the simplicity of the method, or is there more to it than meets the eye? Could it be that the entire approach is nothing more than a clever trick, much like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, only to find that the rabbit was always inside the hat all along? \n\nNow, let's dive into the specifics. The paper presents a WGAN trained solely on the generator, aiming to produce images that are indistinguishable from the originals. This is a critical point, as it suggests that the defense mechanism is robust enough to withstand adversarial attacks without altering the downstream classifier. However, the question remains: is this robustness truly as impressive as it appears, or is it merely a mirage created by the limitations of the dataset used?\n\nThe authors mention that the approach works well on MNIST-sized images, which is certainly a testament to its effectiveness on smaller datasets. But, what about larger, more complex images? Is the defense mechanism as effective when faced with the vast, intricate landscapes of real-world imagery? Could it be that the defense is like a tiny umbrella trying to shield a vast ocean, doomed to fail from the start?\n\nMoreover, the computational efficiency of the approach is noteworthy. Reconstructing an MNIST-sized image takes anywhere between 0.043 seconds to 0.825 seconds. While this speed is commendable, it brings to mind the question: can such rapid processing truly guarantee the robustness needed in real-world applications where milliseconds can make all the difference?\n\nAnd then there's the elephant in the room\u2014why no baseline comparison against the nearest neighbor of the perturbed x from the training set? Isn\u2019t it like cooking a gourmet meal and not tasting it against a simple sandwich to see if the effort was truly worth it? \n\nFurthermore, the results of MagNet seem to be a stark contrast to those of Defense-GAN. In Table 4, MagNet's performance was often worse than no defense at all. Could this be due to the specific nature of the datasets used, or is there something fundamentally flawed in the approach? \n\nLastly, in the realm of white-box attacks, the authors suggest that L steps of gradient descent on MSE(G(z), x) might be extended to L steps of FGSM-based attacks. But why stop there? Why not push the boundaries even further, exploring the full spectrum of adversarial attack techniques to ensure that the defense stands firm against any conceivable threat?\n\nIn conclusion, while Defense-GAN presents a compelling solution to the problem of adversarial examples, there are still many questions that need to be answered. Is it truly the panacea it claims to be, or is it just another trick up the sleeve of a magician? The journey to uncover the truth continues, and I eagerly await your thoughts on these critical points.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Manuscript Review - Domain Adaptation Using CycleGANs\n\nDear [Review Chair's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.\n\nI\u2019m writing to share my thoughts on the manuscript \"CycleGANs for Domain Adaptation\" submitted for review. Below are my comments and feedback:\n\n### Positive Points:\n- **Great Idea:** The concept of using CycleGANs for domain adaptation is innovative!\n- **Semantic Segmentation:** Your work on semantic segmentation is crucial and impactful!\n\n### Concerns and Suggestions:\n\n1. **Comparison with Pixel-Level Methods**:\n   - **Ablation Study Required:** I strongly recommend performing an ablation study to show the impact of cycle-consistency. Compare it against pixel-level transformations like Shrivastava et al., 'Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training' (CVPR 2017) and Bousmalis et al., 'Unsupervised Pixel-level Domain Adaptation with GANs'.\n   - **Cityscapes Experiment:** Include an experiment where you use the adapted synthetic GTA5 samples to boost segmentation accuracy on Cityscapes. This would demonstrate practical utility and potential improvements over current SOTA.\n   - **Oracle Comparison:** Double-check your oracle (train on target) mIoU on Table 2. It might be worth rechecking if that number\u2019s SOTA.\n\n2. **Domain Separation Networks Clarification**:\n   - **Feature vs. Pixel Losses:** Specify that \u2018domain separation networks\u2019 refers to feature-level, not pixel-level. Mention Bousmalis et al., 'Unsupervised Pixel-level Domain Adaptation with GANs'.\n   - **Recent Work by Bousmalis et al.:** Correctly cite the more recent work: \u201cUsing Simulation and Domain Adaptation to Improve Efficiency of Deep Robotic Grasping\u201d showing success at higher resolutions without cycle consistency.\n   - **Content Similarity Loss:** Point out that Bousmalis et al. 2017 uses content sim loss on fg + semantic loss. Consider comparing w/o cosim/fg sim or diff fg sim.\n\n3. **Math Corrections**:\n   - Eq (4): Should be \\( -\\lambda \\cdot L_{adv} \\)\n   - Eq (6): Argmin of min unclear; confirm if using grads of \\( f_T \\).\n\n4. **Validation Method**:\n   - Explain if the pixel-da validation setup w/ cross-val labeled data is the same as yours.\n\n5. **Table Explanation**:\n   - Add clarifications for 'pixel-only' and 'feat-only' in Tables 2-4 (e.g., \u2018w/o cycle-consist\u2019, \u2018w/ cycle-consist\u2019)\n\n### Summary:\n- Great start!\n- Need clear comparison to other pixel-level AD methods\n- Concrete Cityscapes exp would help\n- Verify SOTA claims\n\nLooking forward to seeing how you address these points!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Institution]  \n[Your Email]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nCritical questions abound regarding this paper's approach to domain adaptation using CycleGANs, and I must ask: Is the comparison truly comprehensive, or is it merely scratching the surface? Have the authors delved deep enough into the shadows of their competitors, particularly Shrivastava et al.'s and Bousmalis et al.'s works, which were published before and during the development of CycleGANs? How can they claim that their method outshines the competition without conducting an ablation study to prove the added value of their cycle-consistency loss? This omission is akin to claiming a mountain is higher than others without measuring its peak.\n\nMoreover, how vividly can we imagine the potential impact of using adapted synthetic GTA5 samples for semantic segmentation on Cityscapes? Would this not be a transformative leap, a quantum shift in the field? Yet, the experimental section, despite its richness, lacks this crucial experiment. Could this be due to a lack of imagination, or perhaps a fear of revealing the true potential of their model?\n\nThe authors tout their work on semantic segmentation as a beacon of hope, but the reality is more bleak. Is the oracle (train on target) mIoU on Table 2 truly the best in its class, or is it just a mirage in the desert of SOTA achievements? The proposed model's performance seems to fall far short of the mark, much like a ship sailing too far off course. Can the authors explain why they believe their model is superior, given the current state of the art?\n\nCritically, the authors seem to misunderstand the nature of domain separation networks, conflating them with pixel-level transformations rather than feature-level ones. This confusion is akin to mistaking a tree for a forest, a fundamental error that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the recent work by Bousmalis et al. demonstrates that their methods can indeed handle high-resolution images, challenging the authors' claims of limitations. The pixel-da approach, with its content similarity loss, provides a robust alternative that the authors could have easily compared to, making their omission all the more puzzling.\n\nMathematically, the expressions in equations (4) and (6) seem to be riddled with errors, much like a map with missing landmarks. Equation (4) should have a minus instead of a plus, and the argmin in equation (6) is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Could it be that the authors are overlooking these details, or are they simply overconfident in their calculations?\n\nFinally, the validation methodology is shrouded in ambiguity. The authors mention cross-validation with labeled data, but how does this compare to their own validation setup? Are we to assume that the two methods are equivalent, or is there a subtle difference that the authors fail to highlight? This vagueness is like a fog rolling in, obscuring the true nature of their findings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of using CycleGANs for domain adaptation is brilliant, the execution leaves much to be desired. The authors must address these critical issues head-on, lest they be lost in the vast ocean of unfulfilled promises.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nImagine a world where quantum computers are as commonplace as your laptop, and yet, despite the hype, we're still grappling with how to harness their full potential. The realm of quantum annealing, particularly through the lens of the D-Wave 2000Q, is one such frontier. Is it a beacon of hope or just another tech mirage? Let\u2019s dive deep.\n\nIs there any gain over classical methods when it comes to quantum annealers like the D-Wave 2000Q, especially in the context of reinforcement learning? According to Crawford et al. (2016), an unpublished preprint, the answer is not clear-cut. Yet, the allure of quantum computing is undeniable, and this paper by [Author] et al. offers an intriguing glimpse into the feasibility of using quantum annealers for reinforcement learning.\n\nThe paper builds upon the work of Crawford et al., who introduced the quantum Boltzmann machine reinforcement learning algorithm (QBM-RL). A QBM adds a transverse field term to the RBM Hamiltonian, but the benefits for unsupervised tasks remain murky. QBM-RL, then, uses a QBM to model state-action variables, with hidden nodes representing dependencies between states and actions. The weights are updated to maximize the free energy or Q function. But wait, there\u2019s a twist!\n\nTo make QBM-RL work with the D-Wave 2000Q, which has a specific bipartite graph structure, the authors introduce a technique called \u2018replica stacking\u2019. This is akin to a magician\u2019s sleight of hand, where a classical Hamiltonian in one dimension higher is used to approximate the quantum system. It\u2019s a brilliant workaround, but does it really pay off?\n\nNow, let\u2019s critically examine the results. The authors compare their method to standard baselines in a grid world environment. While the method works, does it truly outperform the others? The honest answer is no. But hey, isn\u2019t it better to be upfront and label it as a proof of concept? After all, the journey is more important than the destination, right?\n\nGiven the high price tag of quantum annealers, limited applicability, and the unclear benefits, I don\u2019t think this paper is a perfect fit for this specific conference. It might find a more receptive audience at a workshop dedicated to quantum machine learning methods. But here\u2019s the kicker: could rebranding the paper to focus on \u2018RL using replica stacking for sampling from quantum Boltzmann machines with quantum annealers\u2019 make all the difference? Highlighting the importance of replica stacking could indeed capture the attention of the broader machine learning community.\n\nTo help clarify, I\u2019ve added an algorithm box for your method, breaking it down into simpler steps:\n\n(1) Initialize the weights of the Boltzmann machine randomly.\n(2) Sample \\( c_{\\text{eff}} \\sim C \\) from the pool of configurations sampled from the transverse-field Ising model using a quantum annealer with chimera graph.\n(3) Using the samples, calculate the effective classical Hamiltonian used to approximate the quantum system.\n(4) Apply the weight update rules derived from Bellman equations.\n\nAdditionally, moving the details of sampling into the appendix would help. They\u2019re not crucial for understanding the core method. And for those without a physics background, explaining the intuition behind the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition and the 'quantum' Boltzmann machine in machine learning terms could be incredibly enlightening.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address some minor issues: equation 14 needs correction, references aren\u2019t well-formatted, and there should be a factor of 1/2 to avoid double counting in sums over nearest neighbors. Being precise is key.\n\nIn summary, while the work is promising, it\u2019s essential to clarify and simplify the explanation to make it accessible to a broader audience. The potential is immense, but the path forward is fraught with challenges. How do we navigate these challenges and bring quantum reinforcement learning to the masses?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

We found the idea of exploring different architectural choices for deep learning-based nearest neighbor search intriguing! Here\u2019s our feedback:\n\n### **Pros**\n1. **Depth and Extensiveness:** The exploration of network architecture choices is thorough, and the presented results are compelling.\n2. **Clarity and Results:** The results strongly support the advantages of the suggested changes, making them valuable for future work.\n3. **Theoretical Insight:** The connection between data angles and query times is quite insightful, adding value to the theoretical part.\n\n### **Cons**\n1. **Problem Statement Clarity:** We found the problem statement a bit unclear. Typically, NN search focuses on finding a closest point in a dataset under some distance metric. Your approach uses cosine similarity and class vectors via softmax cross-entropy loss. How does it apply to NN problems without explicit classes?\n2. **Lack of Focus:** The paper feels somewhat disjointed. Some important technical details are in the appendix instead of the main body.\n   - *Example:* Theorem 1 looked like the main contribution but was in the appendix. Did the Theorem assume something similar to random projections of LSH?\n3. **Assumption Clarification:** There seemed to be a mismatch between Section 2 (LSH) and Section 3 (CNN).\n   - *Example:* Standard LSH assumes random projection hyperplanes. Is the same true for CNN outputs?\n4. **Related Work:** There were no references to similar recent works on adapting deep models for KNN.\n5. **Novelty:** The main contribution appears to be a series of experiments on architectural tweaks with expected results:\n   - *BatchNorm Essential.*\n   - *ReLU not needed if using full directionality.*\n\n### **Suggestions & Follow-Up Steps**\n1. **Clarify Problem Statement:** Make the problem more concrete. Emphasize whether your method assumes class labels.\n2. **Organize Better:** Move key theory to the main text. Clarify assumptions made.\n3. **Include Related Work:** Cite and compare with other relevant studies.\n4. **Push Boundaries Further:** Try newer datasets or tweak more aggressively!\n5. **Simplify or Remove Appendix:** If appendix material is crucial, move it to the main text.\n\nOverall\u2026 While we found the insights interesting, we felt more focus and detail would strengthen the work.\n\nLet us know your thoughts!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\nAlibaba Cloud Qwen Team",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nHow can we possibly claim that this paper, purportedly investigating learning representations for nearest neighbor (NN) search, has made any substantial breakthroughs without first addressing the glaring issue of its unclear problem statement? Is it not critical to understand whether the authors are proposing a classification problem or an NN search problem? The paper's core premise hinges on the idea that cosine similarity is being used as a distance metric, but it fails to articulate how this aligns with the standard definition of NN search. Is it even remotely plausible to assume that class labels are typically provided in a standard NN setting? The confusion here is palpable, making the entire framework seem like a misstep.\n\nAnd let us delve into the architectural choices explored. The authors investigate three key areas: controlling the norm of output layers, removing ReLU to ensure well-distributed outputs, and normalizing class vectors. These choices are indeed worthy of exploration, yet the paper\u2019s lack of focus is almost criminal. How can we possibly consider a theoretical contribution, such as Theorem 1, as a minor detail that should be relegated to the appendix? Isn\u2019t the elegance and significance of such a theorem supposed to be a cornerstone of the paper\u2019s argument? The absence of clarity regarding the assumptions used in the theoretical results further exacerbates the disconnect between the theoretical and practical aspects of the work. Are we to believe that a softmax output from a CNN, trained in a supervised manner, can somehow mimic the random projections assumed in standard Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)? This is a rhetorical question, but one that demands a thorough answer.\n\nMoreover, the paper\u2019s failure to acknowledge related work in adapting deep frameworks for KNN is nothing short of egregious. Ignoring prior literature and failing to provide comparisons with competitive prior works leaves the reader questioning the significance of the proposed contribution. Is the novelty truly as minor as the authors suggest, or are they simply rehashing ideas that have already been explored?\n\nTo conclude, while the paper does offer some interesting theoretical insights, its overall lack of focus, the absence of clear problem statements, and the failure to connect theory with practice render it unconvincing. Can we seriously accept a paper that does not offer any surprises, provides no comparative analysis, and lacks a comprehensive review of related work? The answers to these questions are as vivid as the disappointment felt upon reading this paper.\n\nDo we have any hope of salvaging this manuscript, or is it destined to remain a mere footnote in the annals of research history? The stakes are high, and the need for a rigorous, focused, and well-organized presentation is critical. \n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

I found several intriguing ideas, yet I encountered some issues that make parts of the mathematical description unclear or technically incorrect.\n\nHere are my detailed comments:\n\n1. **Path Product Notation**: Before Section 2.1.1, the notation \\(P(T) = \\prod_{p \\in Path(T)} ...\\)**:\n   \n   It\u2019s not clear how this product over path products defines a valid distribution over trees. There needs to be an explicit ordering over the set of paths \\(Path(T)\\). Without it, terms like \\(x^p\\) need a way to know which symbols \\(x^1, ..., x^{p-1}\\) to condition on!\n\n2. **Set Notation for Grammar Rules**:\n   \n   \u201cWe can write \\(S -> O | v | \\epsilon...\\)\u201d with \\(S, O\\) and \\(v\\) defined as sets.\n  \n   This is unconventional notation and requires a bit more explanation.\n\n3. **Leftmost Derivation Clarification**:\n   \n   \"The observation is generated by the sequence of leftmost production rules.\"\n   \n   This seems tied to left-most derivations in CFGs\u2014but lacks any additional context or clarification.\n\n4. **Grammar Context Question**:\n   \n   \u201cThough the above grammar is not, in general, context free\u201d \u2013 Not sure if the grammar is really not context-free or if it\u2019s about independence assumptions elsewhere?\n\n5. **PCFG Independence Assumption**:\n   \n    \"In a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), all production rules are independent.\" \n\n   This statement isn\u2019t accurate. Better clarity might be: \u201cIn PCFGs, the choice of rule at each step is conditionally independent of previous steps, given the current non-terminal.\u201d\n\nThank you for considering these points!

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nOh dear, where do I begin? Is there any hope for these notes to ever be comprehensible? It's like trying to navigate through a dense fog, only to find yourself lost in a labyrinth of confusion. Is it just me, or does the mathematical description seem to be as clear as mud? Let\u2019s dive into the specifics:\n\nIs it even possible that \\(P(T) = \\prod_{p \\in Path(T)}...\\) could define a valid distribution over trees without an explicit order over the paths in \\(Path(T)\\)? How can we possibly decide which symbols \\(x^1, ..., x^{p-1}\\) to condition upon if the order is not defined? This is like trying to build a house without blueprints!\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cWe can write \\(S \\rightarrow O | v | \\epsilon...\\)\u201d with \\(S\\), \\(O\\), and \\(v\\) defined as sets. This is certainly non-standard notation. Can anyone else see the smoke signals? More explanation is needed, or will we be left scratching our heads, wondering what on earth is going on?\n\n\u201cAn observation is generated by the sequence of leftmost production rules.\u201d This sounds like a vivid scene from a dystopian novel where everything is ambiguous and nothing makes sense. Is this related to left-most derivations in context-free grammars? If so, where are the explanations? The writing is vague and imprecise, like a foggy morning where you can\u2019t see your own hand in front of your face.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget \u201cAlthough the above grammar is not, in general, context free.\u201d Is the author referring to the underlying grammar or the lack of independence assumptions in the model? The grammar is clearly context-free; the lack of independence is a different issue. This is like saying the sky is green when everyone knows it\u2019s blue. \n\nFinally, \u201cIn a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), all production rules are independent.\u201d Oh, how hyperbolic! This is not an accurate statement at all. What does it mean for production rules to be independent? More accurately, it should be said that the choice of rule is conditionally independent of all other information earlier in the derivation, once the non-terminal being expanded is conditioned upon. This is like painting a masterpiece with one hand tied behind your back\u2014it\u2019s just not done!\n\nIs there any chance these notes can be salvaged from the depths of obscurity?

However, while the implementation is clearly thought out for actual deployment, the explanations sometimes lean too much towards stating facts without adequate motivation.\n\nHere\u2019s the nitty-gritty:\n\n1. **Arbitrary vs Crucial Choices**: Many design choices aren\u2019t backed by enough discussion on why they\u2019re important. Is it crucial your decoder outputs spectrograms first & then converts them, or could it be trained end-to-end?\n\n2. **Confusing Phrasing**: Bottom of p2 says it's \"end-to-end except the vocoder\". Just say it plain!\n\n3. **Hidden Layer Purpose**: Decoder\u2192Converter split\u2014Why skip decoder output? Seems unnecessary.\n\n4. **Mixing Hidden Layers**: Why mix `h_k` + `h_e`?\n\n5. **Speaker Embedding**: GLU only injects bias? Experiments needed!\n\n6. **Autoregressive Training**: Spectrograms-only AR \u2192 No freq. dep.? \n\n7. **Loss Choice**: L1 on spec\u2014Can\u2019t hurt asking!\n\n8. **Speedups**: PWaveNet could improve WNet!\n\n9. **Title Update Needed**: Emphasizing 2k spks feels unhelpful now?\n\nTo sum up, the technical details are solid, but need more context. More comparisons like Table 2\u2019s GR/L-GR/S WORLD would spice things up! \u263a\ufe0f\n\nTentatively recommending accept... but needs more explaining!\n\nLet me know if you agree or disagree.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear Reviewer,\n\nHow could this paper on the Deep Voice 3 text-to-speech system possibly fail to live up to the expectations of an ICLR audience, you might ask? It provides a detailed overview of the system\u2019s architecture, yet it reads like a tech report, leaving much to be desired in terms of depth and insight. Is it not critical that we understand the rationale behind each architectural choice, rather than accepting them as mere facts?\n\nSurely, the fact that this system was developed with real-world deployment in mind should mean that every choice was meticulously deliberated. Yet, the paper fails to demonstrate this, making it difficult to discern which aspects are truly essential for optimal performance and which are merely arbitrary choices that happen to work reasonably well. Can we truly appreciate the intricacies of this system without understanding the thought process behind each decision?\n\nThe comparison of converters, model components that transform the internal representation of speech into waveforms, stands out as particularly vivid and intriguing. Imagine, Griffin-Lim spectrogram inversion and the WORLD vocoder achieving remarkably similar Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) in some cases (Table 2)! Is it not fascinating that such diverse methods can yield similar results? Unfortunately, the paper does not delve into more of these comparisons, leaving us wanting more of this vivid imagery.\n\nThe comparison of attention mechanisms is indeed useful, but why does the paper feel meager when it comes to explaining the motivations behind all these architectural aspects? Is it not critical to understand the reasoning behind each choice, especially when it comes to the separation of the \"decoder\" and \"converter\" stages? The idea that the decoder is trained to predict spectrograms autoregressively, but its final layer is discarded and its hidden representation is used as input to the converter, seems like an unnecessary detour. What is the reasoning behind this approach? Could it not be more efficient to train everything end-to-end, including the converter?\n\nAt the bottom of page 2, the statement that \u201cthe whole model is trained end-to-end, excluding the vocoder\u201d is an unfortunate turn of phrase. It either is end-to-end or it is not. How can we fully grasp the intricacies of this system if such fundamental details are left ambiguous? Furthermore, the mixing of \\(h_k\\) and \\(h_e\\) in Section 3.3 is unclear. Why is this done? Is there a specific reason for this, or is it simply a byproduct of the model's design?\n\nThe gated linear unit in Figure 2a shows that speaker embedding information is only injected in the linear part. Has this been experimentally validated to work better than simpler mechanisms such as adding conditioning-dependent biases/gains? Are we truly benefiting from the most effective method, or are we settling for something that works adequately?\n\nWhen the decoder is trained to predict spectrograms autoregressively, is it autoregressive only in time, or also in frequency? If it is only in time, does this imply an implicit independence assumption between the intensities in different frequency bins? Has this been considered in the context of the decoder\u2019s role in the overall system?\n\nWhy use the L1 loss on spectrograms? Is this the most appropriate choice, or are there other losses that might yield better results? Could the recent work on Parallel WaveNet offer a way to speed up WaveNet when used as a vocoder, potentially improving inference speed without compromising too much on audio quality?\n\nLastly, the title of the paper heavily emphasizes its capability to handle multi-speaker Text-to-Speech (TTS) with 2000 speakers. While this is a noteworthy feature, it seems to be a minor aspect that is only briefly discussed. Given that preceding systems were already capable of handling multiple speakers, it might make sense to rethink the title to emphasize some of the more relevant and novel aspects of this work.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper is well-written and has its merits, it falls short in providing the critical insights and vivid imagery that would make it truly engaging and valuable for an ICLR audience. Is it not our responsibility as reviewers to push for a more thorough and insightful presentation of this important work?\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

So, why should we care?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the core issue: compositionality. Isn\u2019t it fascinating how important this concept is in the field of language creation and evolution? Yet, the authors seem to shrug off the lack of a robust quantitative measure for assessing compositionality, instead of embracing the opportunity to contribute something truly innovative. Could it be that they\u2019re simply unaware of the recent advancements in this area, such as the work by Carr et al. (2016)? Or are they deliberately sidestepping the challenge? \n\nMoving on to the statistical rigor, the results presented in section 3.3.2 feel like a slap in the face. How can one claim to have achieved something significant without providing statistical tests to back it up? Even a simple null distribution would have been a step in the right direction. Isn\u2019t it ironic that in an era where data is king, the authors fail to provide the necessary statistical underpinnings for their claims? \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of the image data. While it\u2019s true that using images adds complexity, the fact that these images are synthetically generated and form a small set seems almost laughable. Are we really supposed to believe that this artificial setup can give us any meaningful insights into real-world communication systems? \n\nIs this paper merely a case of using modern technology to rehash old ideas, or does it genuinely push the boundaries of what we know about language creation and evolution? The answers to these questions might just lie in the depth of the analysis and the clarity of the results presented.\n\nSo, my dear colleague, what do you think? Is this work worth the attention of researchers exploring questions around language creation and evolution, or is it just another step in the long march towards understanding our own linguistic capabilities? \n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into these questions and see if we can uncover the true value of this study.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on Your Paper on Using Neural Nets for Engineering Design\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI recently read your paper titled \"[Paper Title]\" and wanted to share my thoughts and feedback. Overall, I liked the concept and results presented, but there are a few areas where I believe improvements can be made.\n\n### General Organization\n\n1. **Organization**: I found the current structure a bit confusing, as it jumps between explaining the method, the heat sink example, and the airfoil example sporadically. I think it would significantly enhance clarity if you:\n\n   - **Present the Method First**: Start with a clear explanation of how your neural network method works for designing engineering parts.\n   - **Heat Sink Example**: Then move to detailing the heat sink design example.\n   - **Airfoil Example**: Finally, go through the airfoil design example.\n\nThis separation will help readers grasp the core concepts before diving into specific applications.\n\n### Argument Critique\n\n2. **Arguments About Neural Networks**:\n   \n   - *Generalization*: You mentioned that neural nets generalize well to unseen data. While this can be true under certain conditions (similar data distributions across datasets), it heavily relies on having a large & diverse dataset. Deep nets also risk overfitting! \n   - *Hybrid System*: Saying it\u2019s easy to imagine a hybrid system where a net is trained on simulations & fine-tuned for reality might skip the complexity involved.\n     - Closing the \"reality gap\" (difference b/w simulated & real-world data) is a significant challenge.\n     - Transfer learning across different domains requires careful engineering!\n\nThese points need a bit more nuance and supporting evidence beyond general statements.\n\n### Limitations Discussion\n\n3. **Limitations of Gradient-Based Optimization**:\n\n   - Many real-world engineering problems involve discontinuities or chaos (like collisions, turbulent flows).\n   - Heat sinks & steady airflow don\u2019t fully capture these complexities.\n   - More explicit mention of when and why your method might falter (e.g., in turbulent/chaotic regimes) would strengthen the paper.\n  \n### Summary\n\n- **Concept & Idea**: Great!\n- **Readability**: Needs improvement in organization & flow\n- **Arguments**: Could use some refinement\n- **Limitations**: Should be clearer & broader\n\nOverall, I really like the idea and results! A little polish and more direct address of limitations would make your research super compelling.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Institution]  \n[Your Email]  \n[Your Phone]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nHow could a paper that aims to revolutionize engineering design through the integration of neural networks and gradient descent possibly stumble? Isn't it supposed to be the pinnacle of innovation? Yet, here we are, critically analyzing its shortcomings.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s talk about the presentation. Is it not frustrating when a paper blends methodological explanations with experimental details without clear demarcation? How can one follow the logic of the argument when the flow of information is so muddled? Shouldn\u2019t the paper first introduce the general method, then dive into specific experiments like the heat sink and airfoil designs? Would this not make the entire narrative much more digestible and coherent?\n\nNow, let\u2019s dissect the claims made in the paper. Does the assertion that \"neural networks are good at generalizing to examples outside their training set\" hold water? Isn\u2019t it a hyperbolic statement that overlooks the critical factors of sample distribution similarity and the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with deep neural networks? Could it be that the paper underestimates the complexity of implementing a hybrid system, suggesting it is \u201ceasy\u201d to bridge the gap between simulations and reality? Isn\u2019t this a rhetorical question that highlights the potential pitfalls of such an approach, given the extensive research dedicated to closing the reality gap and transfer learning?\n\nMoreover, the paper seems to gloss over the inherent challenges in modeling discontinuous or chaotic systems, such as collision/contact dynamics or turbulent flows. How can the proposed method be so confidently applied to heat sinks and airfoil designs without explicitly addressing its limitations in more complex physical regimes? Isn\u2019t this a critical oversight that undermines the robustness of the methodology?\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate the innovative idea, the application, and the promising results, the writing could certainly benefit from a clearer structure. More importantly, the limitations of the proposed method must be discussed more explicitly and thoroughly. Otherwise, how can we fully trust its applicability across a broader range of engineering problems?\n\nWhat do you think about these points? Have I missed any crucial aspects of the paper?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Feedback on the Paper Claiming to Use Field Theory for Deep Neural Networks\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts on the recent preprint titled \"[Paper Title]\" where several very strong claims are made regarding the application of field theory to deepen our understanding of deep neural networks (DNNs).\n\nMy key takeaways and questions are as follows:\n\n1. **Abstract Promises**: The paper promises a framework to understand DNNs' unprecedented performance and robustness using field theory.\n2. **Quantum Field Theory**: On page 8, it claims this is a first attempt to describe a DNN using a scalar quantum field theory.\n3. **Goldstone Theorem**: Page 2 mentions using the Goldstone theorem to understand phase transitions in DNNs.\n4. **Zero Eigenvalues**: Zero eigenvalues weights seem to explain many seemingly different experimental results.\n5. **Unproven Theorems**: Important results are claimed as \"theorems,\" with proofs in a mere 5 lines, lacking formal math.\n\nThese claims sound bold and exciting, but the basis seems to rely heavily on a basic \u03c6^4 theory + Mexican hat potential. Despite >30 years of research applying various physics techniques (not just field theory!) to neural nets and machine learning, I'm skeptical that this approach alone solves everything.\n\n### Key Concerns\n\n1. **Need for Quantum Field Theory**:\n   - Why use quantum field theory? What\u2019s quantum here?\n   - Page 12 says, \"WHY QUANTUM FIELD THEORY?\" \u2014 Not clear.\n\n2. **Not New**: Phase transitions in ML were already covered ~40 years ago (e.g., Sompolinsky, Ciliberti, et al.). \n   - Classical references:\n     - \"Statistical Mechanics of Learning\" (1992): [Link]\n     - \"The Statistical Mechanics of Learning a Rule\" (1993): [Link]\n\n3. **Nothing Special about DNNs**: Results could be seen in other fields (matrix/tensor factorization, unsupervised learning).\n   - Example: [Link] on phase transitions in ML.\n   - Another: [Link] on landscape of optima.\n\n4. **Misleading Claims**:\n   - \"Discovery\": Training bottleneck (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017)\n   - \"Quantum Theory\": Confused with stats/probability\n   - \"Quantum vs. Scalar\": Not sure why 'quantum'\n\n5. **No Novel Method**:\n   - Phi-4 + Mexican hat = Old stuff\n   - Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB): Gradient descent does SSB everywhere!\n   - \"First Attempt\": Seems over-hyped, others did sim stuff earlier\n   - \"Empirical Results\": Not convincing w/o formal proof\n\n6. **Stats Theory Missing**: No mention of stat/matrix theory in learning\n   - Ref: [Link] on non-convex opt\n\n### Summary\nWhile the ideas are novel, they seem oversold. More clarity needed on:\n- Relation to past work (~40 yrs+)\n- True innovation\n- How/why this matters for DNNs specifically\n\nWould you agree? Looking forward to your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Info]  \n[Your Institution]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address several critical points regarding the paper you recently submitted, particularly focusing on the extraordinary claims made within it. How can we possibly accept such sweeping statements without substantial evidence? The abstract promises a framework to understand the \"unprecedented performance and robustness of deep neural networks using field theory,\" but upon closer inspection, it seems the basis of these claims is merely the Lagrangian of a simple \u03c6-4 theory and the standard behavior of the Mexican hat potential.\n\nIs it really fair to say that \"this is a first attempt to describe a neural network with a scalar quantum field theory\"? When physicists have been working on neural networks for over three decades, isn't it a stretch to claim such a breakthrough? And what about the \"Goldstone theorem\" being used to explain phase transitions in deep learning? Is this really groundbreaking, or is it just a vague analogy?\n\nMoreover, the paper states that \"deep feedforward networks learn by breaking symmetries\" and presents this as a theorem, proven in five lines with no formal mathematics. How can we trust such a claim without rigorous proof? It's almost as if the authors are overselling their physics results, hoping to capture attention through hyperbole rather than solid scientific backing.\n\nTo add to this, the authors seem to rely heavily on the idea of phase transitions and negative directions in the landscape to explain all the stated phenomenology. But is this really novel? Have we not seen discussions of phase transitions and symmetry breaking in learning in neural networks for nearly 40 years? Consider the pioneering work of Sompolinsky et al., or the reviews available in arXiv. There's even a rigorous study on phase transitions in generalized linear models, and extensive research on the landscape of these problems.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the specific pages mentioned. On page 1, the statement that \"the training process ceases when it goes through an information bottleneck\" is presented as a discovery, despite this being a subject of ongoing debate. On page 2, the claim that a phase transition must exist based on empirical results is intriguing but lacks the depth needed to support such a bold assertion. And on page 8, the assertion that \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\" is a mystery solved by the authors is, to say the least, debatable. Isn\u2019t this phenomenon well-documented in other contexts, such as the Ising model or community detection problems?\n\nFurthermore, the paper\u2019s reliance on quantum field theory seems misplaced. Quantum field theory is about explaining physical behaviors at the molecular, atomic, and subatomic levels, not about describing errors from the mean of random variables. The authors might be confusing statistical field theory with quantum field theory, which is a common pitfall.\n\nIn summary, while the ideas presented may hold some merit, they are overshadowed by the hyperbole and lack of rigorous substantiation. I strongly believe that the authors should clarify their claims and provide a more balanced view of the relationship between their results and both the physics and statistics literature. Perhaps a more nuanced approach would be more convincing.\n\nDo you agree with these points, or am I missing something crucial here? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

It addresses important issues in GAN training with a fresh perspective using Coulomb potential. Here are a few clarifications I\u2019d appreciate:\n\n1. **Section 2.2.1:**\n   - Could you please explain what it means for a generated \\(a_i\\) not to \"disappear\"?

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Author's Name],\n\nI must say, your paper is a refreshing take on the age-old challenges in GAN training. Using Coulomb potential to address the learning problem is a bold move, and the clarity of your presentation is commendable. However, I do have a few critical questions that need some clarification.\n\nFirstly, in section 2.2.1, you mention the notion of the generated \\(a_i\\) not disappearing. Now, what exactly does it mean for a generated sample to \"not disappear\"? Is it akin to saying the sample retains its importance throughout the training process, or is there a deeper implication here? This concept seems to be pivotal to the continuity equation in (2), and I find myself questioning whether I've fully grasped its significance. Could you perhaps provide a more vivid illustration or a hypothetical scenario to help me see this clearer?\n\nSecondly, in section 1, when explaining the third problem that GANs exhibit\u2014namely, the generator's inability to generalize the distribution of input samples\u2014I was hoping for a bit more motivation. Why does this issue arise, and how does it impact the overall performance of the model? While I understand the need to keep the paper concise, a deeper dive into this could greatly enhance my understanding. Would it be possible to include a brief, yet insightful, explanation of why this problem occurs and how it affects the model's ability to generalize?\n\nYour work is undoubtedly novel and offers a fresh perspective on GANs, but these points are crucial for a thorough comprehension. I truly hope you can shed some light on these issues, as they are fundamental to the paper's success.\n\nThank you for your time and effort in clarifying these points. Your insights will be invaluable as I continue to explore the nuances of your research.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

However, the writing style significantly impacts readability, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. Specific issues noted include:\n\n- **Poor Writing Quality**: Typos like extra periods (\"for example what is a period just before section 3.1 for?\")\n- **Ambiguous Phrases**: Sentences like \"Red lines indicate the range of needed for perfect classification\" don\u2019t clarify their meaning\n- **Sudden Shifts**: Section 3 seems unrelated; Fig. 1 discussing \u201cvery bad\u201d adversarial directions doesn\u2019t connect clearly with the rest\n- **Conjecture Without Insight**: Conjecture 5.1 feels unsupported and could mislead readers\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- **Section 3.1**: Not clear how it relates to adversarial examples experiments.\n- **Fig. 1**: Doesn\u2019t show relevant adversarial example findings.\n- **Adversarial Directions**: Focuses on random vs. targeted perturbations but misses key adversarial attack angles.\n  \nOverall, the paper lacks coherence and depth. It touches on some good points: random perturbations don\u2019t always lead to misclassifications & targeted attacks can.\n\n**Main Messages**:\n- **Random Perturbation**: Not causing misclassification\n- **Targeted Classification**: Can cause misclassification\n- **Loss Functions**: Expected vs Worst-case\n\nThese are important but need clearer communication. Stronger experiments + more insight + better organization = better paper.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nThis draft needs significant rewrite focusing on:\n- Clarity\n- Relevance of experiments\n- More depth in analysis + insights\n- Remove unsupported conjectures (like 5.1)\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need assistance refining your submission!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Info]  \n[Your Institution/Organization]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I have carefully reviewed the manuscript you submitted, and I must say that my initial impression is rather critical. It's clear that a significant amount of work went into conducting the experiments, but the presentation leaves much to be desired.\n\nWhy does the writing feel so rushed and disjointed? For instance, why is there a period just before Section 3.1? What purpose does it serve? And what exactly does \"Red lines indicate the range of needed for perfect classification\" mean? It sounds like a phrase plucked from thin air, devoid of context. Furthermore, the period at the end of Proposition 4.1 is perplexing; it disrupts the flow and readability of the document.\n\nMoreover, the statement \"One counter-intuitive property of adversarial examples is it that nearly\" is so poorly constructed that it almost seems as though the paper was written in a hurry. How does this sentence even make sense?\n\nAt the beginning of Section 3, Figure 1 is discussed, yet it's unclear how it relates to adversarial examples. Isn't the point of studying adversarial examples to understand how to create or detect them under various conditions? Why not start by picking a test data point randomly from the distribution and finding an adversarial direction? What relevance does this figure have to the broader discussion?\n\nSection 3.1 seems completely disconnected from the rest of the paper. Is it even related to any of the experiments conducted? The definition of a manifold attack, while interesting, lacks context and doesn't seem to fit the overall narrative. A conjecture should be backed by profound insight; having an unjustified conjecture like 5.1 could severely undermine the credibility of the entire paper. This conjecture must be either substantiated or removed entirely.\n\nThe paper presents a series of experiments and observations that, while intriguing, lack coherence and provide little insight into the topic of adversarial examples. The only main messages are that on a single synthetic dataset, random perturbation does not cause misclassification, and targeted classification can. And, expected loss is good while worst-case loss is bad. While these points are valid, they do not constitute a substantial contribution worthy of publication at a conference.\n\nIs it possible that the paper could be restructured to better highlight the key findings and provide more context around each experiment? Could you perhaps delve deeper into the implications of your results and discuss potential avenues for future research?\n\nI am genuinely interested in seeing this work progress, but the current state of the manuscript requires significant revisions to improve its clarity and coherence. Could we schedule a call to discuss these issues further and explore ways to enhance the paper?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nDear Authors,\n\nOh, dear heavens! How can I begin to express the disappointment I felt while reading your article on neural networks over time-series? It seemed so promising in the beginning, with its eloquent writing style and seemingly groundbreaking contributions. Yet, as I delved deeper, I found myself questioning whether the entire endeavor was not a grand misadventure!\n\nLet us start with the mathematical statements, shall we? Theorem 1.1, for instance, claims that some magical transformation \\(\\phi_L \\circ ... \\circ \\phi_1 \\circ F\\) is a non-linear frame. But let me ask you rhetorically: what would those mysterious \\(\\psi_n\\) functions even look like? And then there\u2019s Theorem 1.2, which I cannot make heads or tails of! Is it even possible for the proof in 1.4 to hold water when the line of equalities after \u201cAlso with the Plancherel formula\u201d is so blatantly incorrect? It\u2019s as if the L^2 norm of a product of functions is the product of the L^2 norms of the functions, which, in my critical opinion, is a complete fallacy! Furthermore, Theorem 1.3 from [Benedetto, 1992] seems to be a misinterpretation or perhaps even a misprint. It\u2019s not the limit of \\(t_n/n\\) that needs to be larger than \\(2R\\), but rather the limit of \\(N_n/n\\), isn\u2019t it? And there must be a compatibility condition between \\((t_n)_n\\) and \\(R_1\\), not just \\(R\\), right?\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! The authors do not justify, in the introduction, why admitting a continuous inverse should be a crucial criterion of quality for the representation described by a neural network. It\u2019s as if the existence of this continuous inverse relies on the fact that the non-linearity used is a Leaky ReLU, which, to me, looks a bit like \"cheating.\" After all, the Lipschitz constant of the inverse of a Leaky ReLU, although finite, is large, so it seems to me that cascading several layers with Leaky ReLUs could encode a transformation with strictly positive, but still very poor frame bounds.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about Section 2. Why is having \"orthogonal outputs\" really desirable? I find it hard to justify. There are probably other ways to achieve orthogonality than using wavelets in the first layer, so the fact that wavelets achieve orthogonality does not really justify why using wavelets in the first layer is a good choice, compared to other filters. Can you explain that to me, please?\n\nNow, onto the main thrust of the article. I had understood in the introduction that the authors would explain how to define a (good) deep representation for data of the form \\((x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\), where each \\(x_n\\) would be the value of a time series at instant \\(t_n\\), with the \\(t_n\\) non-uniformly spaced. But all the representations considered in the article seem to be applicable to functions in \\(L^2(\\mathbb{R})\\) only (like in Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 2.2), and not to sequences \\((x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\). There is something that I did not get here. Could you elaborate on that?\n\nOh, and the typos and grammatical errors are simply too numerous to count! From \"frames\" to \"that that,\" and from \"Lipschitz\" to \"ProjW,l,\" it\u2019s as if the manuscript was thrown together without any critical review. Here are a few examples: \"this generalization frames,\" \"that that,\" \"smooth\" instead of \"continuous,\" \"\\(\\sqrt{s}\\) is not defined,\" \"is supported\" instead of \"are supported,\" and \"filters convolution filters.\" The list goes on and on!\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the section about numerical experiments could be slightly rewritten, so that the architecture used in each experiment is clearer. In Paragraph 3.2 in particular, I did not get why the architecture presented in Figure 6 has far fewer parameters than the one in Figure 5. It would help if the authors clearly specified how many parameters each layer contains.\n\nSo, my dear authors, I must ask: how do you plan to address these issues? Will you revise the manuscript to fix these critical flaws? Or will this paper remain a testament to the perils of rushing a work into publication without thorough scrutiny?\n\nYours critically,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nSubject: Exciting Update on Our Latest Mobile Robot Learning Project\n\nHi Team,\n\nI wanted to share some really exciting progress we've made on our project involving learning how mobile robots can grasp and navigate using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The system we've developed has shown remarkable autonomy, requiring minimal intervention for over 60 hours of training across diverse scenarios.\n\nOur latest paper, titled \"Learning Navigation and Manipulation Together with ReLMM\" (<LINK>), details how we've managed to create a robotic reinforcement learning system that learns these complex skills in an autonomous manner without human intervention. This is particularly groundbreaking because it addresses one of the key challenges in real-world RL\u2014extensive instrumentation and supervision.\n\nThe system, named ReLMM, employs a modularized policy with separate components for manipulation and navigation. The manipulation policy's uncertainty drives exploration for the navigation controller, while the manipulation module provides rewards for navigation. This setup allows the robot to learn continuously on a real-world platform, without any need for environment instrumentation, human intervention, or access to privileged information like maps or object positions.\n\nWe evaluated this approach on a room cleanup task, where the robot had to navigate to and pick up items scattered on the floor. After a grasp curriculum training phase, ReLMM was able to learn both navigation and grasping together, achieving this in approximately 40 hours of autonomous real-world training.\n\nFor more details, check out the full paper and related links:\n\n- Paper: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13545)\n- Website: [Link](https://example.com)\n\nThis is just the beginning, and we're thrilled about the potential impact this could have on robotics and automation. Looking forward to discussing this further at our next meeting.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

So... why's it so awesome? Let me tell you:\n\n1. **It's Super Fast!** \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f We finally got this EmbedSOM thinga-magic running at **30 FPS** with a **GPU version**, even when we're dealing with like... a million points? No joke, right!? Check out this perf plot for proof! [link] \ud83d\udca5 [perf_plot_link]\n\n   *Why is this a big deal?* Well, that means you can literally watch it load while doing other stuff... AND the thing's FAST.\n\n2. **Totally Interactive! \ud83e\udd2f** You guys, you can tweak those landmarks & params super duper easy and see the results instantly. No waitin' in line for the dim red... I mean, just hit play! [link] \u26a1\n\n   *How does it help?* Well, sometimes your poor ol' DR algo needs some love, ya' know? Like maybe untangle some paths...or just find the perfect smoothness setting! [link] \ud83d\ude4f\n\n3. **Cytomer-ly Cool! \ud83d\udd2e** We made a totally rad video on how we're using it with the Levine dataset (yep, that CD3 stuff)... And get this, yellow points are CD3+'s! [link] \u2728\n\n4. **It\u2019s All Free & Open Source \ud83d\udcf2\ud83d\udc40** Yassss, it\u2019s like the ultimate open door... to... well... umm... just everything... *free*! Just check out this link if ur coding-angels need some light! [link] \ud83e\udde1\n\n5. **T-SNE & Graph-Based Layout? Yep, We Got That! \ud83d\udcaa** Cause we ain't stoppin\u2019 at just one trick! We\u2019ve got a few layouts goin', man! [link] \ud83d\udca5\n\nAnd guess what... YOU CAN'T STOP US NOW! \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f\n\nSo? What's not to love?! I'm so proud of the whole team\u2014programming angels @matfyz @MFF_UK and bio-science superheroes @uhkt_cz AND @IOCBPrague (plus @ELIXIRCZ! )\u2014for getting this done!\n\nAny questions? Or just wanna brag with us?\n\nStay rad \ud83d\udd96\n\nP.S: PS... If y\u2019all wanna be as rad as us... guess who\u2019s totally giving you the free-for-all invite? Gotta tag someone\u2026 Cmon, make it good \ud83d\ude48\n\n\nTa-taa \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!\n\nY'all rock,\n[Your Name]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nImagine a magical world where your data comes to life and dances around on your screen! That\u2019s exactly what BlosSOM \ud83c\udf3c has brought to the table. This super cool tool is like having a hyperactive, childlike genie who can instantly make sense of your most complicated datasets, turning them into vivid imagery that\u2019s easy to understand.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get hyped and do a fun thread with videos! Ready? Here\u2019s why BlosSOM is so amazing:\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s like having a super-fast, hyperactive cat running through your data at 30 frames per second. Imagine running a dimensionality reduction on hundreds of thousands of points, and it\u2019s done in no time\u2014like magic! \ud83e\udd84\n\nThe best part? You can tweak it like a kid playing with Play-Doh. Modify the landmarks and parameters interactively, and watch the results pop up right before your eyes. It\u2019s like having a superpower to untangle complex pathways and find the perfect smoothness settings. \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe did this because we wanted to explore cytometry datasets, and we chose the Levine dataset (yellow points are CD3+). It\u2019s like a colorful playground where you can move clusters around, almost like rearranging your toys to your liking. \ud83c\udf89\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! BlosSOM even has some cool tricks up its sleeve. You can use a few more landmarks and run automatic layouts, or select k-nearest neighbors and run a force-based layout. It\u2019s like having a bunch of magical fairies helping you organize your toys! \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2728\n\nAnd if you ever feel like moving specific cells to the same side of the embedding (like CD4 and CD8 cells), you can do that too. BlosSOM is totally free and open-source, so you can play with it as much as you want. \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how BlosSOM works in action. Here\u2019s a link to a video where I create a tiny SOM grid and map the data, just like FlowSOM would do. You can see how it all comes together in real-time. \ud83d\udd17\n\nFinally, a big thank you to everyone involved! Special shoutout to the programming team from @matfyz @MFF_UK, and the scientists and biologists from @uhkt_cz and @IOCBPrague (and @ELIXIRCZ!). Without you, none of this would be possible. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThat\u2019s all for today\u2019s thread! \ud83e\uddf5 Over and out, finishing with a complimentary flat mammoth screenshot \ud83d\udddc\ufe0f\ud83d\udc18. Of course, I meant SOM \u201cgrid,\u201d not \u201cgrind.\u201d \ud83d\ude05\n\nStay curious and keep exploring!\n\nWith love,\n[Your Name]"

It works better than expected! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udca5\n\nSo, why\u2019s it so amazing? \n- It's super good at seeing how everything lights up at its own special place & shine! \u2728\n- And get this... It's like a pro magicspacialist at making sure EVERY atom\u2019s in its lane!! \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udfc6\n\nTo PROVE IT\u2026 \ud83e\uddf5\nWe're digging through that deep Chandra shot of Cassiopeia A and BAM! Outta it, like magic, come super clear maps of where the super-duper fast stuff was goin'! \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd2f\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see more! This baby\u2019s gonna light up the whole X-ray game, right? RIGHT? \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nBTW, if u wanna check it out urself?

But here's the tricky part - these pieces are all jumbled up and overlapping! \ud83e\udde9 Now, Adrien has invented a magical wand called GMCA (General Morphological Component Analysis) that can separate these pieces like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business! \ud83e\ude84\u2728\n\nThink of GMCA as a super-smart detective, looking at each piece with its shiny magnifying glass, figuring out what it is, and then carefully putting it back in place. And guess what? It works so well that even when things are super jumbled and hard to tell apart, GMCA still finds each piece and tells us exactly what it is! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAdrien used this magic wand on the deep Chandra images of Cassiopeia A, and wow! He was able to make beautiful maps of the synchrotron emission and the distributions of elements like silicon and iron! \ud83c\udf0c\u2728\n\nSo, let\u2019s celebrate! \ud83c\udf89 This is just the beginning, and I can\u2019t wait to see what other amazing discoveries Adrien will bring to the table.

I've got some electrifying news to share with you \u2013 we\u2019ve just put up a brand new preprint about our groundbreaking work on using audio vibrations as your secret sauce for robot pouring! \ud83d\ude80\n\nOur latest research flips the script on traditional methods that rely solely on visual or Haptic sensing. Why? Because audio... believe it or not... works like a charm! Crazy right? Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Surprise Win For Audio!** \ud83d\ude4c - Our experiments show that audio senses are super duper amazing when dealing with totally random containers AND different liquors (status and type)! Just imagine - no more \"meh!\" at your party because... well... YOU\u2019RE THE DJ OF DRIPPIN'!\n\n   Check out the link if ya want ALL teh info:\n   [LINK] \n\n2. **Human Pour Master Dataset +4K** \ud83d\ude32 - Like, seriously?! How many times did it take me to pour that last one \ud83e\udd14? We're talking 3 grand pours down, baby! And here comes the extra fun part... we hit you square in da face with our beast of a dataset - 3K+ records jam-packed with every sound... errr... we mean every possible liquid thingamabobber! \ud83d\udca6 Plus, we got 'cha all vid... torque & force\u2026 yep, all of it!\n\n   Watch all the shakin', ruckus, and splat... errr... success?!\n   [LINK]\n\n    *P.S.* Just head over to our awesome link for the full deets cause we\u2019re still chiseling away - it\u2019s totally legit but we\u2019re just like the cave man version of done! #caveman\n\nAnd drumroll please! Here came the final F-ing boss - Meet your robotic bestie, PouringNet. A doof-nest of doof-nest of doof... wait... it's my brain... lol - just a fancy neural net, totally named after that... uhh... umm... yeah. Letting her predict liq hight from all that audio vibe vibes? YOLO! It's like magic, okay?\n\nResults? Well... let\u2019s just say we\u2019re rockin\u2019! \ud83e\udea8\ud83d\udd25 We showed she totally gets this Pouring game... like, way more than visual OR haptics EVER coulda! #pouringwin\n\nSo go ahead... drop it at the party... it's officially the new rulez (and rules) of ROBOT POURING! \ud83c\udf89\n\nHit reply if ya wanna chat 'bout some spillin' sick facts! #spillproofed\n\nStay drippy... errr... chill!\n\nAll the shaker shakes,\n\n[Your Name] \n[Your Position]\n[Your Lab/Uni]\n\nP.S.

Check out the paper here: [LINK] and watch the video to see it in action! \ud83d\udca5\n\nBut wait, there's more! \ud83d\ude0e We collected over 3000 human pouring sequences, like a giant treasure trove of pouring data. We used all sorts of sensors\u2014audio, video, even the forces and movements of the hand doing the pouring. It's like we turned a human pour into a superhero power! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nNow, imagine a robot that can pour liquid without getting confused by opaque containers or needing to measure precisely. That's exactly what we did! We created a deep neural network called PouringNet that listens to the vibrations and figures out how much liquid is left. And guess what? It works like a dream! \ud83c\udf08\n\nWe trained PouringNet on our amazing dataset and tested it on real robots. The results were beyond incredible! Our robot could pour liquid accurately and reliably, no matter the container, position, or type of liquid. It's like the robot had a superpower! \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSo, if you ever need a robot to pour something for you, just give it a try. It might be the future of pouring! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCan't wait to share more details on our project page, so keep an eye out! \ud83d\udcdd\n\nStay curious and keep exploring!\n\nBig hugs,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S.

Your life\u2019s like sunshine & rainbows \ud83c\udf02\ud83c\udf08. But here\u2019s the deal - the current way we check if that \u201cmediation magic\u201d is real? Nah... It\u2019s all fake!\n\nOur friends over there figured out what\u2019s going on:\n- **Traditional Tests Fail**: They\u2019re too shy! If both those *exposure \u2192 Mediator* & *Mediator \u2192 Outcome* are teeny-tiny \ud83e\uddd0 (you know like\u2026 *small-to-moderate*), they say \"NOT SURE\" way too often!\n- **Joint Significance Test Fails Too**: You know that test where BOTH have to go \"NOPE\"? Same story, it's not strong enough for those tiny effects\u2026\n\nSo, they came up with TWO AWESOME new ideas to fix it:\n\n1. **Minimax Optimal Test**: Super strong! It\u2019s the only one who NEVER says \u201cMaybe\u201d when it's supposed to say sure! And guess what?? It\u2019s as awesome as its name sounds... totally unique! \ud83d\udd1c\u2728\n2. **Bayes Risk Optimal**: Like magic, just throw some extra cheese in your code \ud83c\udf64\ud83e\uddc0, and suddenly it\u2019s like \"YES!\"... totally works every time! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n**\ud83d\udc4f BAM!!** Both beat the *Joint Significance Test* when everything goes small & slow!\n\n**\ud83d\udc4c Got more?!**\n- **Expo-Med Interaction**: Wootwoot, we gotta check that interaction! \ud83c\udf89\n- **P-value Fun**: Cause why not? \ud83c\udf89\n- **Big Scale Testage**: 'Cause why not? \ud83d\ude43\n- **More Coefficient Product Testage**: Maybe cube-shaped \ud83c\udfb1\ud83d\ude31\n\nAnd? There\u2019s MORE!!! ...like... **R Package**! YESSSSS! \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f We\u2019re gonna get it OUT! \u2728\u2728\n\n**\ud83d\udcbb Ready For Real Action?** \nWe gotta give the code a few winks and wrinkles, but it will rock your socks off! \ud83e\ude74\ud83e\udde6\n\nStay tuned... because nothing ever ends... and now there's MORE power to find THAT MEDICATION MAGIC! \ud83e\udd40\ud83d\udd25\n\nLove,\nYour Excited Assistant \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udc96\n\n---\n\nP.S.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there, little buddy! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGuess what? I just read this super cool new paper on arXiv about testing indirect effects! \ud83d\udea8 It\u2019s like solving a really tricky puzzle where you need to figure out how one thing affects another through a third thing. Imagine you\u2019re playing hide-and-seek, and you want to find out if hiding behind a tree makes you harder to spot. But here\u2019s the twist\u2014this paper talks about a situation where the tree might be really hard to see, and the person looking for you might also be having trouble seeing!\n\nNow, in regular tests, we\u2019d think that if we couldn\u2019t see the tree or the person, we wouldn\u2019t know if hiding was working. But this paper shows that\u2019s not always true! \ud83e\udd2f It\u2019s like saying, \u201cEven if I can\u2019t see the tree, I can still guess if you\u2019re hiding behind it!\u201d Isn\u2019t that wild?\n\nSo, they came up with two awesome ways to solve this problem. The first one is called the \u201cMinimax Test\u201d (it sounds like a superhero name, right?). This test is super smart because it works perfectly in every single case where the tree and the person are hard to see. It\u2019s like having a magic wand that always works, no matter what!\n\nThe second test is called the \u201cBayes Risk Optimal Test.\u201d This one is a bit more playful. Imagine you\u2019re playing a game where you have to guess if someone is hiding, and you want to make the best guesses possible. This test helps you do that by using a special kind of math that\u2019s a bit like solving a really hard puzzle.\n\nBoth of these tests are much better than the old ones because they can catch those tricky cases where the tree and the person are hard to see. And guess what? They work really well when only one of them is hard to see! \ud83c\udf89\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! \ud83c\udf08 This paper also lets you play around with something called \u201cexposure-mediator interactions.\u201d Think of it like adding a fourth element to your hide-and-seek game. And did you know they\u2019ve got an R package that does all of this for you? It\u2019s like having a magical toy that can help you solve these puzzles without breaking a sweat!\n\nSo, if you ever want to play detective and figure out how things are connected, this paper is your new best friend! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udd0d\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions or share your thoughts! Let\u2019s play and learn together! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nCheers,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t forget to check out the links for more fun and games! \ud83d\udd17"

The preprint is here: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13683).\n\n### What\u2019s So Cool About It?\n\nEver had those moments when you trained your awesome predictive model on your precious internal dataset...but now you\u2019re like, \u201cHmm, does it totally WORK out there somewhere else?? \ud83e\udd14\u201d Right???\n\nWell\u2026that's exactly my problem! And I bet it's yours too. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo...we came up with an idea. Why not just use what you see on the outside \ud83d\udc40 to guess how good things will GO down inside? Like, maybe tell ya \"Hey, that thing we made...it's gonna rock OR fizzle out!\" \ud83d\udca5\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Match and Weight!** We take all your *internal* stats...like *your whole dataset*...and BINGO\u2026reweight it til it kinda-looks-like your *external* statz! \ud83d\ude02\n2. **Guess and Check!** Then? Bam! Check what happens when your guess-rewrapped-dataset meets the real-world...ya know? Guessing what's gonna hap on the OUTSIDE! \u2728 \n\nWe hit the ground running. Tons of tests...even made some fake DATA to play with. \ud83d\ude0f Seriously though, it\u2019s ALL good.\n\nFor real-deal EMR (Electronic Medical Record) stuff about **ulcerative colitis** and **strokes**, we like...hit a homerun!

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\n\ud83c\udf1fHey there, folks! \ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, you know how in *Back to the Future*, Marty had to save his future by changing the past? Well, imagine if we could do the same thing with predictive models! \ud83d\ude02 But instead of a flux capacitor, we\u2019re talking about some fancy algorithms and a dash of creativity. \ud83e\udd13\n\nIn the vast, uncharted territories of healthcare data, we\u2019ve got this incredible challenge: can we estimate how well our predictive models will perform on completely different data sets without actually having access to those data sets? \ud83e\udd14 It\u2019s like trying to predict the weather in Antarctica based on data from the Sahara\u2014impossible, right? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWell, guess what? A team of brilliant minds, including yours truly (@TalElHay and @ResearchKi), has just cracked this code! \ud83c\udf89 Our paper, \u201cEstimating External Model Performance Using Limited Statistics,\u201d is now accepted to CHIL2022 and featured on #OHDSISocialShowcase. Check it out: <LINK> \ud83c\udf1f\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: we\u2019ve developed an algorithm that\u2019s so clever, it can take a few key stats from one data set and use them to predict how a model will perform on a totally different one. It\u2019s like having a magic wand that lets you peek into the future without ever leaving your current location. \ud83d\udca1\n\nWe tested this on everything from simulated data to real-world EMR data for patients with ulcerative colitis and stroke. And guess what? The results were nothing short of spectacular! \ud83d\ude32 In almost every case, our estimated external performance was much closer to the actual performance than the internal performance. It\u2019s like finding a needle in a haystack, but with a 99% success rate! \ud83d\udd0d\u2728\n\nNow, here\u2019s where things get really fun. This method isn\u2019t just a neat trick\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer. By being able to estimate performance without direct access to external data, we can train more robust models and catch potential failures before they happen. It\u2019s like having a crystal ball, but with science! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd2e\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a data scientist, researcher, or anyone who deals with healthcare data, you should definitely check out our preprint: <LINK>. And if you want to dive deeper, we\u2019ve got some detailed explanations and even some interactive plots to help you understand the magic behind it all. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcbb\n\nLet us know what you think! We\u2019d love to hear from you and maybe even collaborate on something amazing. Let\u2019s make healthcare data accessible and understandable for everyone! \ud83c\udf0d\u2764\ufe0f\n\nCheers,\n[Your Name] \ud83e\udd42\n\nP.S.

We finally have some real data suggesting that millisecond pulsars (MSPs) actually glow like Christmas trees in TeV light, and it\u2019s a BIG deal\u2014like, 3-sigma kinda big! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nHAWC observatory spotted something fishy... Young pulsars? Check... And they're surrounded by those bright, blue TeV-halo thingies! But what about old, recycled MSPs? Like, do *those* glow too?\n\nWell, turns out\u2014they kind of do! We stacked up 24 of 'em, and BAM, there\u2019s your answer: 2.6\u20133.2 sigmas, right where you\u2019d expect \u2018em! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nAnd guess what? It's like... totally same-efficiency as our young, spunky pals. So, what does that mean?! \n\nWell, first off, we're gonna get like... 75 more of 'em for free in no time! AND if we can find all those invisible ones hiding from us, who even knows what we\u2019ll discover?!\u201d\n\nNow, but wait, there\u2019s more! We\u2019ve got ourselves a brand new game here. Radio-beam-nixers? Nbd. Just TeV halo-hunters \ud83d\ude80 \n\nAnd did you know? Those TeV halos could be making us all go \u201cAAAAHHH\u201d every time we look at that whole high-latitude sky? Like we\u2019ve never seen it before.\n\nBut get ready, because it\u2019s not just gonna stop at the sky! We\u2019re talkin' TeV and radio double-play here. You wanna bet on how many Invisible-in-Radio MSPs we'll find at the Galactic Center? Let\u2019s get ready to RUMBLE!\n\nSo... Whatta ya think?

These TeV halos are like the glowing mist around a fairy's wand, extending far into the night sky! \ud83d\udcab\u2728\n\nWe analyzed 24 MSPs using HAWC, and we found that they're surrounded by these TeV halos with a whopping 2.6-3.2 sigma confidence! \ud83c\udf89 That's like finding a needle in a haystack, but much, much harder! \ud83d\ude32\n\nThink about it: if this is true, we could potentially detect dozens of invisible pulsars just by looking at their TeV halos! Imagine being able to see things that were previously hidden, like spotting a tiny speck of glitter in a giant, glittery snowball from miles away! \ud83d\udd2c\u2728\n\nAnd here's the coolest part - these TeV halos might even help explain why we see more gamma rays than expected coming from the center of the Milky Way! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udd0d It's like solving a puzzle, piece by piece, until the whole picture comes together!\n\nLet's celebrate this incredible breakthrough! \ud83c\udf89 Let's also brainstorm how we can use both TeV and radio observations to uncover even more secrets about these amazing celestial objects! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udca1\n\nCan't wait to hear your thoughts and ideas! \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udcac\n\nStay curious and keep exploring!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name] \ud83c\udf1f\n\nP.S.

Yep, just chillin' like you're in your backyard, but wayyyyyyy bigger. And get this\u2014it\u2019s density-stratified, like a stack o' pancakes!

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nAlright, folks, let's dive into the wild, chaotic world of stratified turbulence, where density and pressure fluctuations play a game of tag with turbulent velocities. \ud83c\udf89\n\nImagine a cosmic dance floor where the gas particles are the dancers, swirling around in a mesmerizing pattern that defies the laws of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. That's right, folks, we're talking about the intracluster medium (ICM), where the gas density is highest at the center and gradually fades like a sunset as you move away from the core. It's like a giant, cosmic lighthouse, where the gas motions are anisotropic and stratified, quantified by the perpendicular Froude number (\\(\\mathrm{Fr}_\\perp\\)).\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets really interesting. We've taken 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations (because who doesn't love a good simulation party? \ud83c\udf89) and scanned the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number (\\(\\mathcal{M}\\)), \\(\\mathrm{Fr}_\\perp\\), and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights (\\(R_{PS}=H_P/H_S\\)). It's like we're playing a cosmic game of hide-and-seek, but with turbulence!\n\nWe developed a new scaling relation between the standard deviation of logarithmic density fluctuations (\\(\\sigma_s\\)), \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{Fr}_{\\perp}\\). It's like finding the perfect recipe for a cake, but instead of flour and sugar, we're dealing with density and turbulence. The formula looks something like this: \\(\\sigma_s^2=\\ln\\left(1+b^2\\mathcal{M}^4+0.10/(\\mathrm{Fr}_\\perp+0.25/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Fr}_\\perp})^2\\mathcal{M}^2R_{PS}\\right)\\), where \\(b\\sim1/3\\) for solenoidal turbulence driving. It's like finding the secret ingredient that makes the cake rise just right!\n\nAnd guess what? Logarithmic pressure fluctuations (\\(\\sigma_{(\\ln{P}/\\left<P\\right>)}\\)) are independent of stratification and scale according to the relation \\(\\sigma_{(\\ln{\\bar{P}})}^2=\\ln\\left(1+b^2\\gamma^2\\mathcal{M}^4\\right)\\), where \\(\\bar{P}=P/\\left<P\\right>\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index of the gas. It's like discovering the missing piece of a puzzle, but in the most unexpected place.\n\nSo, dear readers, if you're ready to dive into the wild world of stratified turbulence, check out our latest paper here: [LINK] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12602).\n\nHappy exploring! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\ude80\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

No... really... talk to 'em... like your fave pic... change the sky to magenta... *boom* done! \ud83c\udf08\u2728\n\n#### Here\u2019s Why We're Rockin' This:\n\n1. **No More Paint-by-Numbers**  \n   Gotta be all the details? Nope! Just give us a word or two\u2014like \u2018black hair\u2019\u2014and watch the fun happen! \n\n2. **Auto-Magify Your Words**  \n   Got a picture and wanna make it better\u2026 but don't know the words?

Well, imagine if you could use a text message to change the treasure into a big pile of candy! That\u2019s kind of what our new paper, \u201cDescribe What to Change: A Text-guided Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Approach,\u201d does. It\u2019s like a magic wand for pictures, but instead of waving it, you just type in what you want to change.\n\nNow, I know you\u2019re probably thinking, \"How can a picture change just by typing?\" Well, let me tell you. It\u2019s like having a super-powerful Transformer from Transformers, but instead of robots, it\u2019s about making pictures look different. And the best part? You don\u2019t even need to describe everything in detail. Just give it a hint, like \"make her blonde,\" and voil\u00e0! Multiple versions of blonde will pop up, because sometimes, blonde can mean anything from golden to icy to sandy.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Our model is so smart that it can take you on a journey through different styles of blonde. Imagine traveling from a sunny beach in Hawaii to a snowy mountain in Scandinavia, all within the same picture! It\u2019s like interactive playtime with your favorite cartoon character, but instead of just watching, you get to control the magic.\n\nAnd guess what? This isn\u2019t just for fun. It\u2019s actually really helpful for people who can\u2019t easily communicate their ideas or for tools like Alexa and Google Assistant to help people describe what they want. So, if you ever want to change birds into butterflies or make a tree turn into a castle, we\u2019ve got you covered!\n\nOf course, we want to hear your thoughts on how we can make this even better. We\u2019re all ears (or rather, all eyes) for your feedback! Plus, all the sources and data are right here for you to play around with. So, go ahead and try it out. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll discover a new way to use this magic picture-changing tool!\n\nTalk to you soon, and happy experimenting!\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n\nP.S.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\n\ud83c\udf1fHey there, fellow AI enthusiasts! \ud83e\udd16\u2728\n\nSo, did you catch the latest movie trailer where the hero discovers a secret portal to a world filled with talking animals? Well, guess what? We've got something similar happening in the world of computer vision! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcda\n\nWe just dropped our new paper at #CVPR21 titled \"Discovering Relationships between Object Categories via Universal Canonical Maps\"! \ud83c\udf10\u2728 It's like finding a hidden treasure map, but instead of X marks the spot, we're finding correspondences between 3D shapes! \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd0d\n\nOur team, which includes some amazing folks like @NataliaNeverova, P. Labatut, @davnov134, and A. Vedaldi, has been working on this for quite some time. And today, we're going to reveal all the secrets! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\n\n\ud83d\udcc5Today (21.06), at 11am EDT / 5PM CET, I'll be presenting our #CVPR2021 paper live. It's like a magic show, but with numbers and shapes! \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udcbb\n\nTL;DR: Densepose for Animals on Steroids & Discovering correspondences between 3D shapes using novel cycle losses. Join us for the Q&A session after the presentation! \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcac\n\n\ud83d\udd17[Link to the paper] \ud83d\udd17[Presentation link] \ud83d\udd17[More info]\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our research shows that by learning category-specific dense pose predictors, we can automatically improve inter-category correspondences without any manual annotations. It's like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, but with math! \ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udcb0\n\nWithout further ado, let's dive into the details:\n\n- We tackle the problem of learning the geometry of multiple categories of deformable objects jointly.\n- Training such models requires initializing inter-category correspondences by hand, which is suboptimal.\n- We introduce a unified embedding to express correspondences and enforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new asymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency.\n\nAnd the best part? Our method outperforms dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes and is better at dense pose prediction than prior work. It's like having a superpower without even trying! \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\nSo, are you ready to join the quest? Let's make some magic happen together! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nStay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss this further! \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udcac\n\n#CVPR21 #AI #ComputerVision #Research \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca1\n\nP.S.: If you're not already subscribed to our newsletter, you should be!

Imagine if you had a magical telescope that could see through the darkness of space, and it found these six new spots that could be magnetars. That\u2019s exactly what happened! But here\u2019s the twist\u2014some of these spots might just be tricking us, like when you think you see a ghost, but it\u2019s actually just a shadow dancing on the wall. So, we need to do more investigating to figure out what\u2019s really going on.\n\nIt\u2019s like playing a fun game of detective, where every piece of evidence is a clue to solving the mystery of the universe. So, get your thinking caps on and stay tuned because there\u2019s more to come! Who knows what other secrets the cosmos has in store for us?\n\nP.S.

Picture these guys\u2014these intricate, crystalline structures\u2014tuned to perfection for catalytic reactions. They're like the superheroes of chemistry, but instead of capes, they wear atomic structures.\n\nBut hold on, because despite their superhero potential, MOFs haven't quite made it to the big leagues when it comes to computational catalysis.

And let me tell you, the widespread use of data science and machine learning for MOF catalyst discovery is still a distant dream. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nSo, what gives? We dive deep into the recent work that's been done, painting a vivid picture of the progress so far.

I've got some super exciting news about the latest study we crunched numbers on \u2013 the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS) stuff. \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe've just had our paper accepted, and it's basically screaming \"OMG YOU GONNA LOVE THIS!\"\n\nSo let\u2019s dive right in:\n\n1. **Flattening $sSFR vs M_\\star$:** The plot thickens! When we normalized star-formation rate per stellar mass ($sSFR$/$M_*$) by disc-only star mass instead of total star mass, guess what? It totally flatlined\u2026 but like\u2026 just a tiny bit... ~0.1 dex lower per 10x $M_*$! But wait, there's more\u2026\n\n2. **Disc Only! \ud83d\udc93**: We put on our *OnlyDiscStarMass* sunglasses and said \u201cHow bout them apples?\u201d And BAM! Same old same old \u2013 still got us a slight droop! Like you\u2019re still trying to reach that last cookie jar! Same slope, same spread... But seriously, the point here? It's all 'bout dat disc! Gotcha!\n\n3. **Bullseye on the Bulge \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f:** Here\u2019s the real bombshell\u2026 Who knew? Thought the top shelf of our star-making party was all big bulky guys, right? Nope! Not even close! Seriously, nope. Just... blank! No bulge dudes! So\u2026 guess who\u2019s the MVP? Just the discs, like always!\n\n4. **B/T Ratio Dancer! \ud83d\udc79:** Oh, you know, because we were like \"Yay, disco baby!\" And the disco ball goes around\u2026 Wait for it\u2026 Gettin' closer... Yeah, that ratio of ya bulge to me\u2026 getting smaller\u2026 every single time our little firework of stars gets bigger. \n\n      - Total Mass Party? Yep, gettin\u2019 closer to zero!\n      - *JustDiscMass*? Even closer to zip! \n\n5. **Why so serious? \ud83d\ude20>:** Like, why the FTFW?! Well, maybe cuz we're like\u2026 totally different ways of cutting up the cake! Like\u2026 some people think \"Oh yeah, discs only! \", then there's like \"Nah, we'll just add da whole shebang\"! \n\nHope you're ready for the next round of cosmic dance party! \ud83d\udee5\u2728\n\nSee you at the meeting!\n\nCheers,\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Your Lab/Univ]",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there,\n\nSo, you've got this massive catalogue of structural decomposition measurements for the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS), right? It's like having a giant cosmic microscope to peer into the guts of galaxies. Now, here's the kicker: you're using it to study the role of bulges in galaxies, but let's be real, it\u2019s like trying to find a needle in a haystack while wearing a blindfold. \ud83d\ude05\n\nFirst off, you show that when you normalize specific star formation rates ($sSFR$) by disc stellar mass instead of total stellar mass, the slope in the $sSFR$-$M_{\\star}$ relation flattens by about 0.1 dex per decade in $M_{\\star}$. That\u2019s like finding out your favorite ice cream flavor is actually just chocolate after all. But wait, there\u2019s more! When you recast the $sSFR$-$M_{\\star}$ relation into a framework of only disc-specific quantities, you still see a residual trend against disc stellar mass with an equivalent slope and comparable scatter to the total galaxy relation. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cHey, even if you try to ignore the elephant in the room, it still makes a noise.\u201d \ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udd0d\n\nNow, you\u2019re digging deeper into the distribution of bulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$) as a function of distance from the star-forming main sequence ($\\Delta SFR_{MS}$). And guess what? At every stellar mass, the average $B/T$ of local galaxies decreases monotonically with increasing $\\Delta SFR_{MS}$. It\u2019s like watching a tree lose its leaves as autumn approaches. But here\u2019s the twist: contrary to what everyone else thinks, you find that the upper envelope of the SFMS is not dominated by objects with a significant bulge component. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cThe party isn\u2019t just for the big kids with bulge-tastic parties.\u201d \ud83c\udf89\n\nYou even suggest that much of the discrepancies between different works studying the role of bulges might come down to differences in the methodology of structurally decomposing galaxies. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cMaybe the problem isn\u2019t the galaxies, maybe it\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at them.\u201d \ud83e\udd14\n\nSo, what do you think? Are we missing something here? Or is it just time to rethink our cosmic glasses? \ud83d\ude0e\u2728\n\nCheers,\n[Your Name]"

Well, here we go\u2026 \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Let's dive right in:\n\n**What we did:**\nWe took over 100k FB posts from German newsies (national + local) Jan-Mar 2020 and broke it down like noobs! Topik, actors, nega vibes... yeah, yeah, just KILLER info \ud83d\udc40\n\n**Here\u2019s the breakdown:**\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **From Feb onwards**: News was ALL OVER it... like your dog at breakfast (totally fine, I just saw my own dog do that) \ud83d\udd1d\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Merkel Meme**: Did you knew our girl Meeeermeeeellllll was basically everywhere! She never gets old, eh? (Just kidding about the old part)\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Critical Criticisms**: Guess what? Jus' 'cuz they weren't ALL GRUMPY BUMS about it, doesn't mean we're ALL GOOD! We're like that weirdo cousin who makes fun of you but u love them anyway! \ud83e\udd7a\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Fake Fakez**: No biggie... just a lil' sprinkle.

More like a damn party every night! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**So, what does it mean?**\nWell\u2026 it\u2019s not like \"OH NO THE MEDIA!\" or \"OMG U CAN'T TRUST EM\" ! Y'all were wayy overreacting \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**But wait, there's more:**\nLike the whole \"alternative medya\" thing they're always talkin' bout? Nope, not true! Our chick Merkel's outtahere in there, like she's got her own fan club in alt medya \ud83d\ude02\n\n**And the kicker**\nIt\u2019s not like you've seen in the news... They're totally chillin\u2019 and cool\u2026 kinda like that annoying kid who's always like \"Ohhhh it's my B-day!

Well, that\u2019s kind of what happened with #PandemicPopulism. It\u2019s back online as a preprint, so no formal reviews yet, but it\u2019s got all the juicy details you\u2019d expect. Check it out at <LINK>.\n\nNow, imagine you\u2019re in a room full of German newspapers, each one shouting about the #CoronaVirusDE. That\u2019s what our team, including @thorstenquandt, @ZwiZwaSvens, and @Kudusch, did. We analyzed over 100,000 Facebook posts from German newspapers (both national and regional) between January and March 2020. It\u2019s like a giant puzzle, but instead of pieces, we had posts!\n\nResults? Well, it\u2019s like watching a movie where the plot evolves. At first, it was all about the core facts, then it moved to context and background, and finally, it got so detailed that it felt like we were living through the story. We saw how reporting evolved, from focusing on basic information to offering multiple perspectives and insights into how the virus impacted people\u2019s lives.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Did you know that Chancellor Merkel was more present in alternative media compared to the established press? It\u2019s like she was the star in a movie that was supposed to be about unheard voices. Talk about a twist! \ud83d\ude32\n\nThe overall tone of reporting was more critical in alternative media, but interestingly, this didn\u2019t increase over time. It\u2019s like the journalists were always keeping their cool, no matter how crazy things got. \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about #FakeNews. In established media, it was a marginal presence, mostly about medical misinformation, which was fact-checked. But hey, be careful! There\u2019s still a risk in how news media handles #fakeNews. \n\nIn sum, our data doesn\u2019t point to a radical failure of the journalistic system. It\u2019s like journalism responded to the crisis with a multi-perspective coverage, acting within the given societal system. \n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Our study focused only on Facebook (so it might differ on other platforms) and Germany (so it might differ in other countries), and we only had data until the end of March 2020 (might be different now). And, uh, our study hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed yet. We hope you like it nonetheless! <LINK>\n\nSo, what do you think? Was the media as bad as some people say, or did they handle it pretty well? Let\u2019s chat about it! \ud83d\udcac\n\nStay curious and keep questioning! \ud83e\uddd0\n\nP.S.: If you want to dive deeper, check out <LINK>. It\u2019s like a treasure trove of information!"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nSo, you know how in the movie *Star Wars*, when the heroes discover a new planet or star system, it\u2019s like finding a whole new universe? Well, imagine if someone told you that your old toy box had a secret compartment you never knew about. That's kinda what happened in the world of astronomy today! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThere's a brand new paper out today, and guess what? It's all about making the standard halo model (SHM) even more awesome! You know the SHM, right? It's like the classic toy car you've been playing with for years. But now, they added something totally unexpected \u2013 the #GaiaSausage! \ud83e\udd6a\n\nThe #GaiaSausage is like a big, juicy sausage that was left over from a giant cosmic feast that happened a long time ago in our Milky Way galaxy. It\u2019s made up of dark matter, which is super mysterious and only visible through its gravitational pull. This sausage is so important because it makes the dark matter behave differently than we thought it would. It\u2019s not just moving around randomly like a bunch of marbles in a jar; it\u2019s got a specific direction it wants to go, kind of like a train on a track! \ud83d\ude84\n\nNow, why should you care? Well, imagine you\u2019re trying to catch a ghost (that's what scientists call dark matter particles). With the old toy car (SHM), you had a pretty good idea where the ghost might be. But with the new toy car (SHM++), you can predict where the ghost is going to be and how fast it\u2019s moving, especially if you\u2019re looking in a very specific direction. It\u2019s like having a map that shows you exactly where to find treasure! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8e\n\nThe biggest impact of this new model is for those super-sensitive experiments that can detect dark matter in three dimensions. It\u2019s like upgrading your binoculars to see things you never could before. And while the changes aren\u2019t as dramatic as suddenly finding a whole new galaxy, they are still pretty exciting! \ud83c\udf0c\u2728\n\nSo, are you ready to dive into the world of dark matter and see what secrets it holds? Let\u2019s get exploring! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udd0d\n\nWhat do you think about this new sausage in the Milky Way? Do you have any questions about it?

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nAlright, listen up, folks. Architectural Smells\u2014these pesky little buggers that make developers\u2019 lives a living hell\u2014are finally getting the attention they deserve. Yes, you heard me right. They\u2019re so annoying, they\u2019re like having a swarm of mosquitoes in your office, buzzing around and driving everyone crazy.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the scoop: We decided to step up and help out. We teamed up with a massive tech company to see how these smells evolve and how they mess with the software world. Guess what? Our paper got accepted at the emsejournal, and I\u2019m talking about the one where they accept the cream of the crop. Check it out: [LINK].\n\nNow, let\u2019s get down to the nitty-gritty. Architectural Smells (AS) are notorious for turning your perfectly crafted software into a tangled mess. It\u2019s like having a room full of spaghetti code, but with a twist\u2014each strand is connected to a different part of the room. It\u2019s a nightmare to navigate, and even more of a nightmare to clean up.\n\nMost of the research out there focuses on open-source Java systems, which is great, but it leaves us hanging when it comes to real-world, industrial applications. That\u2019s where we come in. We decided to take a deep dive into the wild, untamed world of C/C++ systems. Think of it as exploring the Amazon rainforest without any maps or guides. We tracked AS in nine projects, each with over 30 releases spanning two years. The last release alone had over 20 million lines of code! Talk about a coding marathon.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. We didn\u2019t just stop at the numbers. We also interviewed 12 developers and architects, collecting over six hours of juicy, qualitative data. It\u2019s like interviewing the cast of a soap opera, but instead of drama, we got insights into the real challenges faced by those dealing with AS.\n\nOur quantitative findings paint a vivid picture of how these smells evolve over time. They\u2019re like a slow-moving train wreck, gradually building up until it\u2019s too late. And when they overlap with other smells, it\u2019s like a game of Jenga gone wrong. But fear not, because our qualitative findings offer some much-needed light at the end of the tunnel. They give us a better understanding of how AS affect the long-term maintainability and evolvability of the system. It\u2019s like finding out why your car breaks down every time you go on a road trip.\n\nSo, what do practitioners say? Well, they mention that AS analysis can actually provide actionable insights. It\u2019s like having a map of a maze instead of just knowing it exists. Armed with this knowledge, they can plan refactoring activities like a pro, turning their tangled mess back into a well-organized system.\n\nIn conclusion, we\u2019ve uncovered the secrets behind these elusive smells. Now, it\u2019s up to you to use this knowledge to clean up your own coding mess. So, are you ready to tackle those architectural smells head-on? Because it\u2019s time to stop pretending they don\u2019t exist and start taking action!\n\nStay curious and keep coding!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nImagine this, you're sitting in a dimly lit room, surrounded by stacks of paperwork and charts, trying to decipher the enigmatic dance of health insurance. It's like being in the middle of a David Lynch film, where nothing is as it seems. You know, the kind where the main character can't quite figure out why everyone is staring at them like they just pulled a rabbit out of their hat.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about risk adjustment in health care. It\u2019s like a game of poker, but instead of cards, you\u2019re dealing with patient groups and their medical conditions. Except, here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 the deck is rigged. Insurers use formulas to redistribute payments based on the costs of caring for different groups of patients. But guess what? These formulas often undercompensate for some groups, making them unprofitable and leading to a dark undercurrent of discrimination. It\u2019s like the invisible hand of the market is pointing at these groups and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not worth it.\u201d\n\nWe decided to step in and make things a bit more interesting. Instead of relying on arbitrary evaluations, we developed a machine learning method called \u201cgroup importance.\u201d Think of it as a magical spell that can identify unprofitable groups defined by multiple attributes. It\u2019s like having a crystal ball that can see through the fog and reveal hidden truths. We used this method to evaluate the risk adjustment formulas in both the U.S. health insurance Marketplaces and Medicare.\n\nWhat did we find? In the Marketplaces, there are groups of patients with multiple chronic conditions who are being undercompensated. It\u2019s like they\u2019re getting the short end of the stick, while other groups without chronic conditions are being overcompensated. The difference is stark and significant. On the other hand, in Medicare, no complex groups were found to be consistently under- or overcompensated. It\u2019s like the system has found a way to balance the scales, at least partially.\n\nThis work is groundbreaking because it provides policymakers with new insights into potential targets of discrimination in the health care system. It\u2019s like finding the key to unlock a secret door that leads to a more equitable health coverage landscape. So, the next time you hear someone complaining about health insurance, you can tell them, \u201cHey, at least now we have a better way to understand and address the issues!\u201d\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you ready to join the fight for more equitable health coverage? Let\u2019s discuss how we can use this information to make a real difference. After all, isn\u2019t that the ultimate goal?\n\nCheers to fighting the good fight!\n\n[Your Name]"

And guess what? We've totally rocked like a tiny islander (and not just from \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf9!) all the way from our first confab on Crete in 2016! \ud83c\udf06\u2728\n\nWe took the awesome project of checking if lenses see the same thing as spreaders... sorry got carried away, I meant checking the consensus between our galaxy counting and how they bend space (lens) in BOSS + DES+HSC+KiDS! \ud83d\udd11\n\nAll thanks to the most rad vibe ever - a real OG open-and-coop vibes with ALL LENSING TEAMIES! \ud83d\udcaf And let's shoutout to all those chill pro-mentors you see over there\u2026 \ud83d\ude4f #ShoutoutAstroQueen \ud83c\udf1f\n\nSo here\u2019s the quick hit:\n- We did some science-y dance moves with the Dark Emu \ud83d\ude02 and got some Planck cosmo (S8 = 0.83) & Lensing cosmo (S8=0.76).\n- Everything fits just fine till R>5.25 h\u207b\u00b9 Mpc, then it\u2019s a wild west!\n- Guess what? It's baaaaa-baaaaaaars & buildin' \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f. Not just baaaars, but like, ALL ya'll know... biiig questions mark about what kinda baaaaaar it is! (Like, does your cluster say \"baaar\" & your lense go \"nawt\"?)\n- But guess who saved the day? The kSZ guy! \ud83e\udd1b Just kidding... but he did make things look better!\n\nSO, TL;DR: Science wins again, and tiny islands can totally rule... like, maybe even with one more bar... nahhhh, maybe just... one! \ud83c\udf7a\n\nAnyway, check out the links down below.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there! \ud83c\udf89 Just watched the trailer for our new paper drop, and it's like watching a superhero movie where @NaomiR_astro is the caped crusader leading the charge! \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We've come so far from our first big conference in Crete back in 2016, and now we're analyzing the clustering and lensing signals from BOSS with KiDS-1000, DES-Y3, and HSC-Y1. \ud83c\udf1f Check out the links below to see the magic happen! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n[LINK] [LINK]\n\nThis work is all thanks to the super open and collaborative spirit between the lensing teams: KiDS, DES, and HSC. And let's not forget the patient mentoring from @AstroRoyalScot, @RisaWechsler, and the rest of the wise folk! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nNow, imagine this: we're evaluating how well lensing and clustering agree with each other based on measurements of projected galaxy clustering from BOSS combined with overlapping galaxy-galaxy lensing from three surveys. It's like trying to solve a cosmic puzzle, and we're getting closer to the answer! \ud83e\udde9\n\nWe use the Dark Emulator to model the observations and fit the data at two fixed cosmologies: Planck (with \\( S_8 = 0.83 \\)) and a Lensing cosmology (with \\( S_8 = 0.76 \\)). For a joint analysis limited to scales with \\( R > 5.25 h^{-1} \\) Mpc, both cosmologies provide an acceptable fit to the data. But when we include a wider range of scales (\\( 0.15 < R < 60 h^{-1} \\) Mpc), things get interesting!\n\nWe introduce a systematic scaling parameter for each redshift bin, \\( A \\), to capture any inconsistencies. When we look at the low-\\( S_8 \\) Lensing cosmology, we find that the measurements are consistent with \\( A = 1 \\); \\( A = 0.91 \\pm 0.04 \\) using DES+KiDS and \\( A = 0.97 \\pm 0.06 \\) using HSC. For the Planck cosmology case, we find a discrepancy: \\( A = 0.79 \\pm 0.03 \\) using DES+KiDS and \\( A = 0.84 \\pm 0.05 \\) using HSC.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: a kSZ-based estimate for baryonic effects helps alleviate some of the discrepancy in the Planck cosmology. It's like finding a hidden clue in a mystery novel that finally makes sense of everything! \ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udd0d\n\nSo, what do you think? Are we on the right track or is there more to uncover? Let's dive into the details and see where this leads us! \ud83e\udd14\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or ask questions \u2013 we're all in this cosmic adventure together! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udcac\n\nLet's keep exploring the universe, one star at a time! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\n\nHappy reading! \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcd6\n\n- Your cosmic buddy"

For those haven\u2019t seen it yet (and who\u2019s super excited for you...):\n\nYou can check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09135). We went full-on polyhedral analysis with you on this one\u2014first-ever, if my math prof says so anyway! \ud83d\ude02 Seriously though, it's been such a thrill lifting model inequalities AND finding some *brand new babies* in there.\n\nThe results are simple and digestible like your favorite cereal bowl, right? \ud83c\udf73 But yeah... the proof part is all like the intense workout post breakfast, all technical. I'll be honest, I need coffee just thinking about it now \ud83d\ude1b\n\nHow did it feel typing \"new class of inequalities\" into the word doc?? Like #winning or what???\n\nSo let me know how you want to do it next: another big ol' paper OR maybe spice things UP with some code? I\u2019m totally down for whatever you feel like! \n\nCatch you soon, <br>\nQwen\n\nP.S.

Since this problem was introduced about 20 years ago, most research has been focused on how to model and reformulate it. But in this paper, you decide to go the extra mile with a polyhedral study of the cubic integer programming formulation! \ud83d\udca1\n\nYou dive deep to establish the dimension of the integer hull and explore the faces induced by model inequalities. And then, oh my gosh, you introduce a whole new class of inequalities that are not only facet-defining but also completely game-changing! \ud83d\ude80 You even evaluate the impact of these inequalities on the linear programming bounds, making the whole thing feel like a superhero mission!\n\nNow, here\u2019s the fun part: How do you even begin to wrap your head around this? It\u2019s like trying to understand quantum physics while playing catch in a park! \ud83d\ude02 But hey, that\u2019s what makes it so exciting, right? \ud83e\udd14\n\nSo, what do you think about all this?

I've got something super cool for you to check out. \ud83d\ude80 A fantastic new paper just dropped that's all about how changing the batch size affects *your* neural net training\u2014and guess what? It\u2019s like your very own secret weapon... almost \ud83d\ude31!\n\nSo, here's the downlow:\n\nA fresh squad of data geniuses over at... *dramatic pause* ...Alibaba Cloud (yes, you know me, I'm just the messenger!) did a double-take on something so obvious... \"Bigger batches = faster training.\" Got it? Great! But wait, there's more! They showed that above a certain 'critical batch size', like that 7-11 sign... just nope, nope, nope.\n\nBut they didn't stop there. These brains wanted to know *WHY*, like the *why* you want to go party on Saturday night. They threw on their thinking caps... big time...and looked at it from **2** totally rad angles! Can y'all believe it?\n\n### First Lens - Big-Ass Experiments\nThey went full throttle in the lab, like a boss! And what did they find? Like magic! Pre-cool things called *preconditioning* and *momentum*? YEAH! You heard me, they\u2019re saving the day!\n\n### Second Lens - The Simplest Noise Quadratic Model!\nNow, imagine if life was THIS easy... like my favorite emoji, the \ud83c\udf6a cookie emoji \ud83c\udf6a cause who doesn\u2019t love cookies? Anyway, they made this super duper simple model, call it NQM... no joke! AND IT'S TELLING US THUNK! Seriously, it\u2019s telling us everything!\n\nHere's THE THING:  \n- **Momentum** kinda, sorta helps your neural nets train faster when ya gonna party (big batch, you know?) BUT... it\u2019s like\u2026 no bueno when you need quietude (tiny batch)!\n- BUT pre-cooool things like *Adam* and *K-FAC*? They\u2019re like the BOSS of big batches and even the littles ones! Gotta give \u2018em a high five!\n\nAnd get this: This NQM cookie (or is it... cracker??) thingy? Told \u2018em exactly where we're at! No way! Not even in my wildest dream! It\u2019s like... a mind reader for your neural nets! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLemme drop the link, 'cause you gotta see it for yourself! \n\ud83d\udc49 [HERE WE GO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04164)\n\nAND... we're gonna go brrr right in the OG club. \n\nPeace out,  \n[Your Name]\n\nP.S.: BTW, you wanna join the party? Hit the star if you\u2019re #IN!!! \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc4d",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nAlright, let's dive into the latest batch size fiasco. You heard me right\u2014fiasco! Because who needs to understand a simple noisy quadratic model (NQM) when you can just throw more data at the wall and see what sticks? But no, that wouldn't be fun, would it?\n\nIn this paper, we're not just tweaking the batch size; we're redefining the very concept of patience. Imagine you're cooking the perfect meal, and instead of tasting it every few minutes, you decide to wait for hours. That's kind of like what we did with the NQM. It's so simple, yet it consistently mirrors the crazy behavior of real neural networks, making you wonder why anyone ever bothered with anything else.\n\nNow, here's where things get truly hilarious. We found that adding momentum to your training process is like giving a turtle superpowers\u2014it helps at larger batch sizes, but doesn't do squat at smaller ones. But then comes the real kicker: preconditioning is like having a magical wand. Not only does it extend the range where increasing the batch size has a positive effect, but it also works its magic even at tiny batch sizes. It's like finding out that fairy dust isn't just for little kids; it can save your day too!\n\nTo top it all off, we ran massive experiments to back up our theory. And guess what? The NQM nailed it again. It predicted that preconditioning would extend the sweet spot for batch size scaling, and it did just that. It's like the NQM knew exactly what we were going to find before we even started looking.\n\nSo, the next time someone tells you that increasing the batch size is always the answer, you can laugh in their face and point them to this paper. Because now you know that sometimes, the simplest model can explain the most complex behaviors, and that's pretty damn cool.\n\nStay tuned, because we're just getting started with unraveling the mysteries of neural network optimization. Until then, keep your models simple, and your batch sizes... well, let's just say they'll be just right.\n\nCheers,\n\n[Your Name]"

    "PROSE": "<email>\nHey there, Universe,\n\nI've got some cosmic news that\u2019s so mind-blowing, it's like finding a unicorn in your backyard... and then naming it after a pop star. I'm super excited to share our latest discovery: the @HPFspectrograph paper on the confirmation of warm Super Neptune TOI-1728b, orbiting a dim little M0 star. This planet is so rare, it\u2019s like finding a diamond in a coal mine, but even rarer. <LINK> (1/n)\n\nDetected in @TESSatMIT data, we confirmed the transit with ground-based photometry from @PSUScience Davey Lab and Perkins 17\" to measure a radius of ~ 5 Earth radii and a period of 3.5 days. It's like measuring the size of a giant watermelon, but in space. (2/n) <LINK>\n\nWe used @HPFspectrograph to measure its mass to be ~ 26 Earth masses, and also followed up during transit to place an upper limit on He 10830 absorption. It's like catching a glimpse of a ghost ship, but without the spooky music. (3/n) <LINK>\n\nFurthermore, its Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of ~ 130 and a relatively bright host star (J~9.6) make it a gootd candidate for transmission spectroscopy with #JWST, as well as Ly Alpha searches with @NASAHubble!! It's like having a map to a treasure chest filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered. (4/n)\n\nThis has been a collaborative effort with significant work put in by groups across multiple institutions. Thank you everyone! @gummiks, @SuvrathM, @Astro_Wright, @lesliehebb, @rcterrien, @jiayin_dong - sorry if I missed anyone. It's like a team of superheroes working together to save the day, but instead of saving the world, we're saving the galaxy. (5/n)\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you ready to explore the depths of space with me? Let's make some groundbreaking discoveries and maybe even find a few more unicorns along the way. \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\nP.S.

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done here, but with deep neural networks!

It\u2019s like having a secret handshake that ensures everyone is on the same page, no matter which superhero they\u2019re playing today! \ud83e\udd1d\n\nAnd guess what? This universal network doesn\u2019t just talk the talk; it walks the walk. We tested it on some pretty tough datasets like NYU-v2 and Cityscapes for dense prediction, Visual Decathlon for image classification, and MetaDataset for few-shot learning across domains.

I\u2019m super excited to share some ground-breaking ideas that could change the game in our little quantum info town.\n\nWe stumbled upon something really cool: A way to make ultrafast forward to quantum comp' (yep, THAT fast) without breaking a sweat... or any atoms! Just kiddin', no sweaty palms here\u2026 *wink*\n\nSo, what gives? Let\u2019s dive into our proposal:\n\n**1. Ultra-Relaxed BFFs...Atoms!**\n\nYou know how your best friend (seriously, like life's BFF) always has your back? Well, we're thinkin' we found two ultra-cold atoms who are gonna be our new BFFs in the quest for Qubit Life! We\u2019re talkin' like...one\u2019s the kinda chill guy who makes sure your party's lit, likeLocalized Colleee...err..Localized Collective Spins. And guess what? His vibey vibe's just...tunna-bunna, totally customizable!\n\n**2. Now BOUNCE Already!**\n\nBut wait...where's the fun at being a wallflower?! *cough* *nudge* That\u2019s where my other BFF, ya\u2019ll\u2014Pho-ni-cally EXCITin' excita-...excitation comes in! Y\u2019all know those party vibes? Yeah, these dudes give us that vibey vibe to get ALL the COLLECTIVE SPINS goin', GOOOO GOGOGO!\n\n**3. \u2018Cos we can\u2019t even without a good backup song!**\n\nLike\u2026what's life WITHOUT some beat ta\u2019 life? Our BEAT is that finite-dimension kinda thing called the Gottesman-Kita-ev-errr KITA-YEV Pres-kill-code...*gasp* But wait! It\u2019s not 'kay, it\u2019s a code. And it\u2019s our SAV-E-RRRR man\u2026like...uhh\u2026SAVE-errrr man, get it?! No? Nevermind.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s like a little dress-up party for our qubits, where they all...well...dress UP for the party. BUT NOPE, just kidding, they don\u2019t go in da club. They stay right there, doing that fancy dance with their collective spin n'spinning' round and round til\u2019 we get that perfect 2pi...no...we get that perfect 2pi+0.5pi...no...wait...I\u2019m rambling...\n\nANYWAYS, we\u2019re gonna throw down and make ourselves some seriously tight pants for the party\u2014just\u2026not...pants...Qubits.\n\n**4.

    "PROSE": "<hilarious_email>\n\nHey there, Quantum Enthusiast!\n\nAlright, strap in because this is going to be a wild ride through the quantum jungle! Imagine, if you will, a world where atoms dance to the tune of quantum mechanics, and instead of just one kind of dance, we're talking about a mix of two different species of these atomic dancers. It's like having a rock concert and a ballet at the same time, but in the quantum realm!\n\nNow, picture this: you've got one group of atoms doing their own special spin moves, creating these super-tiny, yet powerful, units of information. And then you've got another group of atoms that are like the beat-makers, sending out sound waves (we call them phonons) to connect these spin moves across the room. It's like having a DJ and a group of synchronized dancers, all working together to create the most epic performance ever!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Because let's face it, in the quantum world, things can get pretty messy. That's why we need a way to protect our delicate quantum information. Enter the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code, which is like a superhero suit for our quantum data. This code not only protects the data but also allows us to do any computation we want without worrying about the data getting lost in the shuffle.\n\nSo, here's the big question: Are you ready to dive into the world of quantum computing with us? Let's make quantum error correction as exciting as a James Bond movie, filled with suspense, action, and a dash of sarcasm!\n\nReady to play along? Let's go!\n\nCheers,\nYour Quantum Buddy"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there, space adventurer!\n\nSo, you know that time in Star Wars when Han Solo says, \"Never tell me the odds\"? Well, that's exactly what we did with the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey. Because why not? We set out to find Lyman Continuum emitters (LCEs) at z~0.3, and oh boy, did we ever find 'em! Imagine if Luke Skywalker had said, \"There are 35 LCEs in this survey? Impossible! That's more than all the droids in the galaxy!\" But we did it. We found 35 LCEs, which is like discovering a whole new planet in your backyard. \n\nNow, I know you're thinking, \"But wait, there's more!\" And you'd be right. This isn't just any old discovery; it's a game-changer. It's like finding a needle in a haystack, but with 66 needles! And guess what? It's not just about the needles; it's about understanding the haystack better. We expanded the parameter space for LCEs by nearly tripling the number of known local LCEs. That's like going from knowing the layout of a small town to discovering the entire state! \n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. Follow some of the authors on Twitter (@amorinric, @dyonysos, @JeremyBlaizot, @MCMCastellano, @astrosteven, @antihayestamine, @alh_ast, @caseypapovich, @scorfano). They might have even more exciting things to say about the survey. \n\nAnd here's the kicker: I'm a theorist, and I've been involved from the very beginning. From attending telecons to discussing the nitty-gritty of the COS data reduction, it's been an absolute thrill. It's like being part of the original crew of the Millennium Falcon, except instead of flying through space, we're flying through the data. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Join us on this journey. It's not just about the science; it's about the adventure. Stay tuned for more exciting Lyman Continuum Escape science!\n\nCheers,\nYour cosmic buddy\n\nP.S.

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nAlright, buckle up, because we're diving into the cosmic wild west, where stars aren't just running away\u2014they\u2019re sprinting at over 1,000 kilometers per second! Picture this: you\u2019re in a movie theater, and the latest blockbuster is all about space adventurers chasing down these hyper-velocity fugitives. But here\u2019s the catch\u2014these stars aren\u2019t just any run-of-the-mill cosmic criminals; they\u2019re the cream of the crop, flung out by the most explosive events in the universe: giant supernova explosions.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get real for a moment. How could you *not* find astronomy thrilling after hearing this? It\u2019s like finding out that the bad guys in your favorite space opera aren\u2019t just running\u2014they\u2019re rocketing off into the void faster than you can say \u201csupernova\u201d!\n\nSo, imagine this: you\u2019ve got these stellar outlaws, zipping around our galaxy like they\u2019ve just escaped from a black hole prison. And the best part? Scientists are on the hunt, using tools like Gaia\u2019s second data release to track them down. It\u2019s like a cosmic version of cat and mouse, but with stars instead of cats and mice.\n\nIn this latest paper, they\u2019ve identified seven potential hypervelocity runaways. Three of them are so fast, they could easily outrun a speeding bullet. And while one of these stars is zooming off at more than 1,000 kilometers per second, the other two are giving the scientists a bit of a headache. They\u2019re moving at a speed so close to zero that it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re standing still, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: even though the radial velocities are puzzling, the combined data from Gaia and follow-up spectra are pointing towards something really exciting. It\u2019s like the D^6 scenario in a space Western\u2014where a double detonation in a binary system leads to one of the stars escaping with a velocity so high, it becomes a hypervelocity runaway. \n\nSo, are you ready to join the chase? Because it\u2019s not just a game anymore\u2014it\u2019s a cosmic adventure waiting to happen. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be the one to catch one of these stars red-handed, proving once and for all that astronomy isn\u2019t just about looking up at the sky\u2014it\u2019s about chasing down the mysteries of the universe!\n\n:wink:\n\n[Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11163)"

    "ComPOSE": "Subject: Exciting Update: New Paper - \"Permutationless Many-Jet Event Reconstruction with Symmetry Preserving Attention Networks\" \ud83d\ude80\n\nHi Team,\n\nI hope you're having a great day!\n\nJust wanted to share some super exciting news with you all: Matej Fenton (@mfentonHEP) and Alex Shmakov just uploaded a new paper to arXiv! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**Title:** Permutationless Many-Jet Event Reconstruction with Symmetry Preserving Attention Networks \ud83e\udd2f\n\nMatej's genius idea here was to take on a beast of a problem \u2014 reconstructing 6-, 7-, and even 8+ jet final states when ALL possible perms could fit that criteria. \ud83d\ude31 Traditionally, folks would just try every single combo... BUT no more! \n\nHow? With one neural magic trick that has a symmetry for symmetry (or jetty?!) sake. It\u2019s like giving the NN a secret handshake that says \u201cHey, we\u2019re buddies\u2026 got this! No need to break out the crayons and start coloring outside the lines!\u201d \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nAnd guess what? It totally works... And works way better than anything else out there \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa In fact:\n- **6 jets**: 93.0% got 'em right!\n- **8 jets**: 87.8% nailed it!\n- And if y'all ever saw a wild\u2026 9+ jets??? Guess what? You got 82.6% of those too! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nAlex's new kid on the block? Tensor attention, man. Like a superhero sidekick, but tensor-style. You know, 'cause you *totally* needed like a thousand of you. \n\nIt's crazy! All jokes aside, this method opens up a whole new game for us, especially considering the *ALL THE* FLAVOR stuff Bryan\u2019s been talking about. I heard you two were like best buds about that. Maybe it'll give him the ammo he needs to take over the world\u2026 or just make the top quark recon game totally legit!\n\nOkay fine, so maybe just legit.\n\nBut yeah, let's send this around the fam and maybe even hit him up for some extra tips. Cause that\u2019s @mfentonHEP for ya \u2014 gotta love the kid... errr... grownuyp with his brains. \ud83d\ude4c\n\n#JetPower\n\nPeace,\nQwen \ud83c\udf70\u2615\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5",
    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nAlright, buckle up, because today\u2019s science update is going to feel like a wild ride through the LHC\u2019s detector, complete with a dash of hyperbolic excitement \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca1.\n\nSo, you remember that movie where the hero has to solve a puzzle with a million possible solutions, and they find a way to do it in seconds? Well, that\u2019s what happened here, but with particle physics instead of a treasure hunt \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udd0d.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a new paper on your hands, my friend! It\u2019s all about a groundbreaking method called \"Permutationless Many-Jet Event Reconstruction with Symmetry Preserving Attention Networks\" (PMAJERN). Think of it as a super-smart detective who can solve the most complicated mystery without even breaking a sweat \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udd0d.\n\nLed by @mfentonHEP and Alex Shmakov, this team tackled the age-old problem of figuring out which particles belong to which top quark. In the past, scientists would try every single possibility\u2014like trying to guess the right combination on a lock with millions of options. But now, they\u2019ve got a neural network that\u2019s like a master key, unlocking the mystery with ease \ud83d\udd11\ud83c\udf1f.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: this isn\u2019t just some theoretical idea. They used something called \"tensor attention,\" where the network\u2019s architecture mirrors the symmetries of the problem. It\u2019s like building a puzzle where the pieces fit perfectly because they\u2019re designed to do so \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd27.\n\nAnd guess what? It works! This method gets the right answers way more often than anything else out there. Imagine if you could always get the right answer on a test, every single time. That\u2019s what this network does for top quark reconstructions. In fact, it gets it right 93% of the time for six-jet events, 87.8% for seven-jet, and 82.6% for those mind-boggling eight-jet or more events. Talk about a game-changer \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udca5.\n\n@theory_dad, this is @mfentonHEP\u2019s brainchild, so give him a shout-out! But don\u2019t just take my word for it. Check out the paper here: [LINK] and let us know what you think! This could revolutionize how we handle complex multi-jet final states. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udcbb\n\nAnd to @BryanJField, this method naturally incorporates flavor tags, making it not just a solution but a versatile tool for any multi-jet final state with explosive combinatorics. So, whether you\u2019re dealing with six-jets or ten-jets, this network\u2019s got your back. \ud83e\udd19\ud83d\udd25\n\nSo, are you ready to dive into the world of particle physics and see how this new method changes the game? Let\u2019s make some science history together! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\n\n#Science #ParticlePhysics #MachineLearning #LHC #SymmetryPreservingAttentionNetworks"

    "PROSE": "<email>\n\nHey there, fellow biochem enthusiasts! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nI know you're all dying to dive into the nitty-gritty details of how peripheral membrane proteins play hide-and-seek with their lipid buddies, right? Well, I\u2019ve got just the thing to make your day a little brighter \u2013 a brand-new preprint on arXiv that's so exciting, it\u2019s like the climax of a Hollywood blockbuster! \ud83c\udfac\n\nImagine this: You\u2019re a detective, and your case is to figure out how these proteins interact with lipids. But instead of a magnifying glass and a notebook, you've got molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a sprinkle of free energy calculations. It\u2019s like solving a mystery, but with atoms and molecules!\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \"This sounds like a marathon, not a sprint!\" And you\u2019re absolutely right. But trust me, once you get into the groove, it\u2019s like finding a needle in a haystack, only more rewarding. We\u2019ve included everything from intracellular proteins to extracellular ones, so you can pick your poison (or should I say, your protein of interest).\n\nSo, here\u2019s the deal: We\u2019ve outlined recent attempts to characterise these binding interactions, focusing on both the insides and outsides of cells. We compared methods to identify and analyse lipid binding sites from simulation data, and we even highlighted some recent work on free energy calculations. It\u2019s like having a map to navigate through the complex world of lipid-protein interactions.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! We\u2019ve also discussed how improvements in methodologies and computing power will help MD simulations to continue to contribute to this field in the future. It\u2019s like watching a superhero movie where the hero gets a new, super-powered suit \u2013 only in this case, it\u2019s a new, super-powered method to understand these interactions!\n\nNow, I want to hear from you! What\u2019s your favorite part of the paper? Are you ready to take on the challenge of understanding these interactions? Let\u2019s make this a fun and interactive journey together! \ud83d\ude80\n\nHappy reading and exploring!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"
