### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand. He is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

### Format 1

The questions will ask you to evaluate the summary *line by line to classify them as either consistent, or inconsistent to the story.*

##### Question: Is this line in the summary consistent with the story?

This question is asked for *each line of the summary*. Mark each line as either consistent or inconsistent to the story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story. The lines in the summary that do so can be classified as inconsistent. Some lines include commentary about the story, which should be ignore when evaluating consistency. For such lines, select N/A. For summary A:

* The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain: **Yes**
* One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees: **Yes**
* The story paints a vivid image of human suffering: **N/A, just commentary**

For summary B:

* Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain.: **Yes**
* One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand: **Yes**
* He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall: **No**

##### Question (for any answers marked No): Provide an explanation for your selection.

For every line marked inconsistent, provide a short explanation for your answer selection. For example, for the line from **Summary B**: "He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall.", a possible response is:

This line is inconsistent with the story since the minister was sitting in the puddle of water in the story instead of lying in it.

---

### Format 2

The questions will ask you to evaluate some of the summary lines to *choose to swap them with an alternate line.*

##### Question: Would you swap the line with its alternate?

This question is asked for *some lines in the summary*. Please make a choice and provide a short explanation for your answer selection. To make a choice, you can use the guideline that the events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story.

For example, for the line from **Summary B**: "He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall.", would you swap the line with "He is shot when in a puddle of water near the hospital wall":

The response is *Yes* since the line to be swapped removes the inconsistency stated that the man was lying in the puddle.

---

### Format 3

The questions will ask you to evaluate the summary *line by line to highlight any portion that is ambiguous to evaluate with respect to the story.*

##### Question: For each line in the summary, highlight any portion that makes the line ambiguous with respect to the story.

This question is asked for *each line of the summary*. Please highlight all the portions by clicking and dragging the cursor on the text and provide a short explanation as to why you highlighted this portion as ambiguous. To make a choice, you can use the guideline that the events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story.

For example, for the line from **Summary B**: "He is shot while lying in a puddle of water near the hospital wall.", a possible response is highlighting the following portion:

He is shot :red[while lying in a puddle of water] near the hospital wall.

An explanation for this could be that the man is clearly shot when sitting in the puddle and could be interpreted as almost lying in the water. Thus, this portion of the line is subjective.
