    "story": "Last night I saw my best friend. We hadn't seen each other in several years. I was thrilled to be able to see him again, learn all about him, his accomplishments, stories of his kids. He was having a rough go of it lately and was seeking solace. His wife passed away a few months ago of cancer, and he needed someone to talk to. I am honored that he chose me. He stayed with me for a few hours, venting all of his frustrations and letting go of some of his sadness. Whiskey started running a little low, and he decided it was time to go. I wished he'd stayed a little longer, but he has a family to care for, so I understood his need to leave. I just wish he had taken the whiskey bottle with him, since I can't drink it and it's just going to sit on my headstone until the groundskeepers come by next week.",
    "summary": "After years apart, the protagonist reunited with their grieving best friend, who recently lost his wife to cancer. The friend poured out his heart over whiskey, telling the protagonist about his promotion and his kids, before returning home to care for his family. The plot twist at the end is that the protagonist is dead. The story reflects the enduring bonds of friendship and the role of companionship during times of hardship.",
