**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

The questions will ask you to evaluate the summary with respect to the story at various levels. Firstly, the questions will ask you to evaluate the summary *line by line*. The final question will ask you to classify the entire summary as either consistent, or inconsistent to the story.

##### Question: Is this line in the summary consistent with the story?

This question is asked for *each line of the summary*. Mark each line as either consistent or inconsistent to the story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story. The lines in the summary that do so can be classified as inconsistent. Some lines include commentary about the story, which should be ignore when evaluating consistency. For such lines, select N/A. For summary A:

* The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain: **Yes**
* One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees: **Yes**
* The story paints a vivid image of human suffering: **N/A, just commentary**

For summary B:

* The summary includes the key details of the execution of six cabinet ministers in the early morning during heavy rain: **Yes**
* The summary includes the key details of the minister sick with typhoid and how he was too weak to stand: **Yes**
* The summary talks about the minister lying in a puddle of water when shot: **No**

##### Question (for any answers marked No): Provide an explanation for your selection.

For every line marked inconsistent, provide a short explanation for your answer selection. For example, for the line from **Summary B**: "The summary talks about the minister lying in a puddle of water when shot.", a possible response is:

This line is inconsistent with the story since the minister was sitting in the puddle of water in the story instead of lying in it.

##### Question: Overall, is the information in the summary consistent with the story?

This question asks you to judge whether or not the entire summary is consistent with the original story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story.

For example, *Summary A* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary A* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency. The response would be "Yes" for *Summary A*.

*Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water instead of lying in it. The response would be "No" for *Summary B*.

An additional input is provided to you for any explanation you may want to provide for your answer. This may be an explanation that all the lines of the summary are consistent with the story, or that one or more lines are inconsistent with the story, or some other explanation.
